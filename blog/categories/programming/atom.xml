    <link href="https://geshan.com.np/blog/2016/03/there-are-only-two-types-of-automated-software-tests/"/>
    <updated>2016-03-17T16:38:18+11:00</updated>
    <id>https://geshan.com.np/blog/2016/03/there-are-only-two-types-of-automated-software-tests</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tests check that the code does what it is expected to do. It also gives confidence to the software engineer that the code
works as intended. This equates to less or no bugs in the software. You must have heard about lots of types of automated software tests.
There is unit testing, integration testing, functional testing, acceptance testing, smoke testing etc.
As per Guru99&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.guru99.com/types-of-software-testing.html">post</a> there are more than 100 types of
software testing. In this post I am going to categorize automated software tests into two, the fast ones and not fast ones.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/testing-types/software-testing.jpg &lsquo;There are only two types of automated software tests, fast ones and not fast ones&rsquo; &lsquo;There are only two types of automated software tests, fast ones and not fast ones&rsquo; %}</p>

<h3>How do you distinguish between slow and fast tests?</h3>

<p>Generally, if your whole tests suite runs in seconds it is fast.
If your whole test suite runs in minutes/hour it is slow. To make your tests small you need to make your application small.
As faster tests running on your Continuous Integration (CI) service will give you faster feedback.
May be it is time to go micro-services?</p>

<p>Lets discuss the more about fast and not fast (slow) automated software tests.</p>

<h3>The fast tests</h3>

<p>Fast tests are code that test one unit of code generally a method. Unit test is a type of fast test.
They don&rsquo;t depend on any external dependencies. External dependencies include file system, database, web server, network
or any third party API or service. Unit tests even mock the other code elements they need like other classes and its methods.
This makes the test focused on one unit and they run in milliseconds/seconds not minutes. A simple example is below:</p>

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/http://github.com/geshan/dataprovider-example/blob/master/tests/DataProvider/Example/Test/CheckoutTest.php"></script>


<p>You can view the full code <a href="http://github.com/geshan/dataprovider-example">here</a>, yes it is a simple class with no code or external dependency.</p>

<p>Some integration tests can also be fast tests. These integration tests can test many classes. They should not
dependent on any external dependencies mentioned above to obtain speed. So these tests will still run in seconds and
not take minutes to finish.</p>

<h3>The not fast tests (slow ones)</h3>

<p>Any test that takes long to run are not fast tests (slow tests). Generally, these type of tests need to load
the whole application to test it. These types of tests depend on external dependencies. External dependencies include file
system, database, web server, network, third party API or service.</p>

<p>Acceptance tests that need to load a full web application on a browser is a type of slow tests. Even smoke tests if it needs
to load the whole application and takes long time to execute fall in this category.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/geshan/4512326704954f6b8388.js"></script>


<p>The above example is taken from <a href="https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/blob/master/features/checkout/checkout_with_offline_payment.feature">Sylius</a>
project, to test checkout with offline payment method on the browser.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Testing is super important for a robust software application. Automated testing + CI is one of the <a href="http://geshan.com.np/blog/2015/10/4-pillars-of-a-solid-software-application-and-tools-to-support-it/">four pillars</a>
of any solid software application. Happy testing hope your tests run in seconds not minutes.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being updated is an important need for all technology professionals. These days, there are many ways to get updated and we are at times overwhelmed with the things we read. To help this situations, and get a rundown of a curated list of links to read for any topic is subscribe to a weekly.</p>

<p>Weeklies are compact and organized list of links with articles, podcasts, videos etc. They are focused to a related to a topic, technology, language or framework delivered to you email inbox each week. This post curates a list of 3 weeklies for all software engineer/developers. The main 3 weeklies are language and framework agnostic. Towards the end there is mention of some language, framework and CMS specific weeklies.</p>

(Background image shot by me.)</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Weeklies</h2>

<p>3 great weeklies you should subscribe to are:</p>

<h3>Changelog Weekly</h3>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1WQnesg">Changelog Weekly</a> comes out every Saturday. It give you a well balanced rundown of all things open source. It covers major headlines, projects and repos, videos. It also includes pings posted on its <a href="https://github.com/thechangelog/ping">ping</a> repository. So you can try a ping too :)  ChangeLog weekly is a great way to stay updated. It covers all new open source news and repositories.</p>

<h3>StakeShare Weekly</h3>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1N19Mx0">StackShare Weekly</a> is released every Friday/Saturday. It includes a post on how one company scaled or improved its stack. For example last week it covered how ProLeads moved from <a href="http://stackshare.io/proleads/how-we-moved-from-heroku-to-containers-with-no-docker-experience">Heroku to Docker</a>. Then it summarizes new and top 10 tools, products or services. Stack Share has a great listing of many services, products and tools categorized well. Their newsletter is super helpful to get up to date with the latest tools and services.</p>

<h3>DevOps Weekly</h3>

<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1NugCFO">DevOps Weekly</a> is released every Sunday. It recaps the major news, events and tools from the devops fraternity.  As software engineers/developers we are going more full stack. This implies that we should also be aware of the system side of things. DevOps Weekly includes condensed links from docker and containers to  monitoring, performance and security.</p>

<h3>Other Weeklies</h3>

<p>Some of the other weeklies I am subscribed to are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.phpweekly.com/">PHP Weekly</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.docker.com/newsletter-subscription">Docker Weekly</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">Javascript Weekly</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://nodeweekly.com/">NodeJs Weekly</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.theweeklydrop.com/">Drupal Newsletter</a></p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you are working with <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.pythonweekly.com/">python</a>,  <a href="http://androidweekly.net/">Android</a>, <a href="https://iosdevweekly.com/">IOS</a>/<a href="http://swiftweekly.com/">Swift</a> or even <a href="http://golangweekly.com/">go lang</a>. The only thing you need to do is Google <code>&lt;your language/framework/CMS here&gt; weekly</code> and subscribe to it. I think you will like the curated links you get each week.</p>

<blockquote><p>Weeklies have helped me get updated on the technology/language/framework/CMS I use or know. I hope it helps you in the same way. Happy weekly subscribing.</p></blockquote>
