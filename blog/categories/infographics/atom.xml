    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looking for the right web hosting provider for your website/app idea? It is like finding a housing for yourself. You have to first agree on the type like you want an apartment in a building, your own house/villa or may be a mansion. It will also depend on your budget and what you want to do in your housing. A similar process applies for your web hosting. You can go for a shared host or dedicated host or some cloud Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS ) provider.</p>

<p>In the infographics below I will do a basic comparison between shared host, dedicated host and cloud provider. They are roughly comparable to an apartment, house or a mansion. I am over simplifying things grouping Virtual Private Server (VPS) and dedicated hosting together.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A big earthquake hit Nepal on 25-Apr-2015 and another big one was felt on 12-May-2015. The <a href="http://seismonepal.gov.np/">aftershocks</a> till now have been around 250. I pray that all the people in Nepal have the strength and positive energy to endure this difficult time. Rather than pitying on themselves, people have already started to work and this is a positive sign. Moreover, instead of spreading false news and rumors I would suggest people to focus on positive things, stay alert and cautious.</p>

<p>I had some time so I setup a survey to know the software engineering practices used in Nepal and in the past 2 weeks there are 90 responses from the survey.  Below is the first infographics in the series to showcase the software engineering practices used in Nepal ranging from Computer Languages, Project Management technique and software to Deployment practices.</p>

<p><strong>Data for this infographics is taken from this <a href="http://bit.ly/nep-dev-survey">survey</a>, I kindly request you to fill it.</strong></p>

<p>The Infographic below covers details of Language, Framework, IDE, Company Size, Male to Female Ratio and some other data extracted from the responses. A special thanks to <a href="http://bit.ly/ashish-singh-blog">Ashish Singh</a> for helping me clean up and compile the data in a better way.</p>
