    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I gave a talk at #devopsdaysNewy on 24-Oct-2018. It was a great conference with lots of amazing people.
I want to thank the organizers for putting together such an amazing event. I want to extend the thanks to the sponsors who made it possible :). It was very good couple of days to meet new people and form a network. I think my talk on microservices went pretty good too. It was my second devops days and I enjoyed it.</p>

<h2>The abstract</h2>

<p>Are you frustrated working with large, legacy and potentially lethal code bases? We were frustrated too,but in 4-5 years of time, we replaced A (front-end) and B (back-office) system with ~150 microservices. From the days of no tests and clumsy deployment process, we moved to each service with unit tests, CI and deploying with a bot. With the business buying in the process, we enabled the business to reach new heights. This talk reveals that journey and the things we learned along the way.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your work responsibilities boil down to 2 things, either add value to customers or save cost for the business.
Value to the business is always more important than the latest technical fad. If a feature is done (production
ready) but not deployed to production it is an opportunity loss for the business.</p>

<p>Below are the slides of my
talk titled &ldquo;Adopt a painless continuous delivery culture, add more business value&rdquo; given today at

<h2>The Abstract</h2>

<p>A continuous delivery of new features definitely adds value to the business, it should be effortless to the tech team too. 5 years back our sys-admin team was in Istanbul and the dev team was in Dubai. Even then changes were shipped periodically but the process was cumbersome. A stable delivery pipeline with tests, continuous integration and small atomic deployments with github flow gives us a leading-edge. The culture of logging and monitoring ingrained in our team helps us move fast. Now, we ask a chatbot to deploy our microservices several times a day to production. In this session, I will unveil details on how you can get started with a smooth continuous delivery pipeline one step at a time.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The first day of DevOps Days PDX 2017 was pretty impressive. Looking forward to day 2!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being a senior software developer is more about the mindset and pro-activeness. Technical skills can take you to a point then you will be stagnant. To grow you need to learn in tech field. Above was the context for my talk titled &ldquo;Things I wished I knew as a junior developer&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Main points</h2>

<p>It mainly highlights the 10 points below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Solutions and value to business is much more important than the latest language/framework.</li>
<li>Be strong in the basics.</li>
<li>First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. - John Johnson</li>
<li>Writing simple and clear code is more difficult than writing magic code.</li>
<li>Code reviews help both the reviewer and reviewee.</li>
<li>(Automated) Testing is easier than debugging.</li>
<li>Automation is King.</li>
<li>Application logs + monitoring save your sleep.</li>
<li>Non tech things are very important like proactive communication, being on time etc.</li>

    <link href="http://geshan.com.np/blog/2016/08/number-laraconeu-2016-was-a-great-experience-overall/"/>
    <updated>2016-08-25T13:59:03+10:00</updated>
    <id>http://geshan.com.np/blog/2016/08/number-laraconeu-2016-was-a-great-experience-overall</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It all started with submitting my chatops talk to some open call for papers in April 2016. After giving the talk in CodeMotion Dubai, I felt chatops is a useful topic. Everyone working in software development can leverage it to make their life easier. My talk was a Laravel centered version of the same talk.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/laracon-eu-2016/laracon-eu.jpg &lsquo;Laracon EU 2016&rsquo; &lsquo;Laracon EU 2016&rsquo; %}</p>

<h2>Talk Accepted - Woo hoo!</h2>

<p>My talk got accepted in around mid-May for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LaraconEU&amp;src=tyah">#LaraconEu</a> 2016. It was amazing news that entailed other things to take care of. I had to sort out visa first. I want to thank Shawn for keeping like 3 months + time between paper selection and the conference. This is great for speakers like me who have to sort out the paperwork. It is also useful for speakers who get enough time to prepare for their talk.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is something that all conference organizers should  consider when organizing an &ldquo;international&rdquo; conference. Select speakers/talks like 3 months or more in advance.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Suggestions to conference organizers</h3>

<p>Then after I confirmed my presence, I started taking care of the paperwork for the visa. I also had a chat with Shawn over Skype. He gave me some pointers to make the talk more suited to the Laravel Developers audience. It was super handy.</p>

<p>Along the same lines I have 3 more suggestions to conference organizers:</p>

<ol>
<li>Have a conversation with speaker after talk selection. Advise them about content.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t always strive for fresh content. The speaker might have presented it earlier. Think of how the speaker can mold it to suit your conference audience.</li>
<li>Be adventurous with speaker selection. I agree it&rsquo;s a risk to select a speaker who needs a visa to be at the conference venue. Still, if you give enough time like ~3 months things generally work out :).</li>
<li>Give speakers with potential a chance, have that trust.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Conference Experience</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s fast forward to 22-Aug-2016 now, I arrived in Amsterdam. I am here in Amsterdam after 5 years, still seems like nothing much has changed here :). I can&rsquo;t write anything about the workshops as I did not attend it. The organizers were well prepared. All speakers already had access to the speaker&rsquo;s handbook. The telegram group was useful too.</p>

<p>Most speakers were staying at Park Vitoria Hotel. It is right infornt of Amsterdam Central. 15 mins train ride from the venue and I must tell you its a great hotel to be in.</p>

<h3>Speaker&rsquo;s dinner</h3>

<p>The ice breaking speaker dinner was great. Speakers interacted and got along well with each other. I guess they also changed their selected talks to attend talking with other speakers. I want to thank the organizers of Laracon EU for the effort they put into speaker hospitality.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/laracon-eu-2016/speaker-dinner.jpg &lsquo;On the way to the restaurant for speaker dinner&rsquo; &lsquo;On the way to the restaurant for speaker dinner&rsquo; %}</p>

<h3>Conference Day 1</h3>

<p>Day 1 on 23-Aug-2016 kicked off like half an hour late due to minor technical issues. Taylor Otwell rocked the stage as usual. One thing, I noticed is even a seasoned speaker like Taylor gets a bit nervous before going to stage. So for us rookie speakers it is absolutely  normal to be nervous.</p>

<p>Then I attended the talk by Hannes Van De Vreken about IOC Containers. The talk was quite helpful. We took the train together to the venue. Still, I was preparing for my talk that was after lunch.</p>

<p>My turn was next after lunch. Ubuntu wasn&rsquo;t helping much with the huge display that needed 50 Hz refresh rate. After some googling, it played out well without issues.  My talk went pretty smooth and I even got a few questions a the end. I guess I managed my time well.</p>

<h2>Video Of My Talk on Chatops</h2>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SZ3UfwBACIo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>After that I attended the following talks for the day:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to avoid database migration hell - which was good</li>
<li>Varnish For PHP Developers - that was a bit of too much code still good</li>
<li>One Box Doesn&rsquo;t fit all - by Frank which was a different way at looking at scalability, still, it was a great talk.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Conference Day 2</h3>

<p>I was more relaxed on day 2, I had no talk to do. Then I focused on getting the best out of the day. Below are the talks I attended:</p>

<ol>
<li>Please Understand Me by Matthias Noback - Great talk about the tussle between Mangers and Developers</li>
<li>Lucid Architecture By Abed Halawi - Good concepts and well presented</li>
<li>Building Realtime apps NodeJs way By Sriram - He had too many slides so I was lost mid-way :)</li>
<li>Making the most out of MYSQL By Gabi - A great talk, good content and well presented. The experience of the presenter was visible on stage.</li>
<li>The State of content management By Tihomir - Generally a good talk, as I told to him the contents could be condensed better.</li>
<li>Curing the common Loop By Adam Wathan - Amazing talk a good mix of slides and live coding. Collections seems like the lodash of PHP world.</li>
</ol>


<p>{% img center /images/laracon-eu-2016/adam-laracon-eu.jpg &lsquo;Adam talking about Curing Loops at Laracon EU 2016&rsquo; &lsquo;Adan talking about Curing Loops at Laracon EU 2016&rsquo; %}</p>

<p>For more description of the above talks it&rsquo;s best to have a look at the Laracon EU 2016 <a href="http://laracon.eu/2016/schedule">schedule</a>.</p>

<p>The after party on day 2 was superb too. With live band performing and tech conversations around the atmosphere was electric.</p>

<h2>Amazing Experience</h2>

<p>Overall, it was an amazing experience. The venue was great. Organizers put a lot of effort to make sure the speakers felt comfortable. I
want to thank them. The comments I have received over <a href="https://joind.in/talk/9999a">JoinedIn</a> about my talk have been very helpful, I would really like
more ratings and comments :).</p>

<blockquote><p>I am waiting for the videos like everyone else, I have some talks I missed that I want to watch. I loved being a part of such a vibrant event backed by
an amazing community. Cheers!</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After almost 2 years, I gave another talk to the students of <a href="http://prime.edu.np">Prime College</a>. Last time it was &ldquo;<a href="http://geshan.com.np/blog/2014/08/things-i-wished-i-knew-while-doing-my/">Things I wished I knew while doing my tech bachelors</a>&rdquo;. This time it was <strong>Career Paths for to be tech graduates</strong>. I prepared the slides at 9 and was already presenting the talk at 11:15.</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="d2961b06460a443c8e13535d8add0260" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>


<h2>Participants</h2>

<p>The students were from <a href="http://www.bsccsit.com/">Bsc. CSIT</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_in_Information_Management">BIM</a> of second and fourth semester. They were high on youth and not worried about their careers. As it was a short talk, I wanted the session to be interactive. I was trying to get more questions out of them. Some of them were shy to ask the questions so they came in later after the talk to have a chat with me.</p>

<p>{% img center /images/career-paths-for-tech-grads/cptg-02.jpg &lsquo;Career Paths for tech graduates the participants&rsquo; &lsquo;Career Paths for tech graduates the participants&rsquo; %}</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>Questions centered towards roles and problems faced by tech companies in Nepal. I answered the queries with the things I knew and what I had experienced when I was working in Nepal. Few of them were enthusiastic about opening up their own company. I wish them best of luck.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Students get serious about internship, job and career only towards their final semesters. I think they should start planning for their internship at the mid of their bachelor study. By the &frac34; stage, they should know which career path should I take.</p>

<blockquote><p>I hope the short talk and QnA session helped some of the participants to think about their career plans.</p></blockquote>
