In search of a web hosting comparison and review site I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.4cheapwebhosting.com">4CheapWebHositng.com</a>. With a clean layout this website offered the things I or anyone searching a web host needs to know about web hosts put in a coherent manner.With that in place the categorization of hosts as per platform like Linux, Windows or scripting language like PHP, ASP, JSP makes it easier for the person searching for a web host.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SSVm14tlf3I/AAAAAAAAAuQ/yPsMP_7ALCU/s1600-h/4cheapwebhosting.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 293px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SSVm14tlf3I/AAAAAAAAAuQ/yPsMP_7ALCU/s400/4cheapwebhosting.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5270732014849720178" border="0" /></a><br />The quick search on the left comes in very handy if you want to search for a specific price, platform or disk space required.

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
Its been time I have been coding. I remember the things way back when I built my first website with just HTML, tables and loads of tables. Then I knew about frames etc etc. It was way way back and now I&#8217;m into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php" target="_blank" title="PHP at Wikipedia">PHP</a> coding/programming/developing whatever you want to call it.<br /><br />In the years I&#8217;ve coded I&#8217;ve found out different paths to follow while coding. I&#8217;m giving it a PHP tilt as I&#8217;ve worked with PHP on a professional level. I&#8217;ve tried my hands on ASP, JSP and other things but just on a college project level. This blog post is mainly focused on server side programming with PHP and not explaining about Javascript or any client side things or AJAX.<br /><br />Lets see and compare the 4 ways (not tools) to develop/code your own PHP website or web application. The following are the ways you can code/develop your application (involving more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank" title="CRUD at Wikipedia">Create Read Update Delete - CRUD</a>) or a website (that has visitors and is more Web 2.0 - It does have CURD but thats not its core). The table below reveals the comparision:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SR5XM1JhehI/AAAAAAAAAto/VNwKnQWE86E/s1600-h/table_method_features_ok.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 216px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SR5XM1JhehI/AAAAAAAAAto/VNwKnQWE86E/s400/table_method_features_ok.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268744492007127570" border="0" /></a><br /><h3>1. Self Code/Native Code:</h3>This now seems a conventional way. Gone are the days when you start from scratch for your website/web application. If you self code your site you have full flexibility to use objects, functions or just use loads of pages with no functions discard the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRY" target="_blank">Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself (DRY) </a>rule and code how ever you want. You know the work-flow how variable pass and all things but all at your own risk.<br /><br />But its your call to spend precious time reinventing the wheel and copy pasting the code several times and making your maintenance hard or follow some convention and standard. Undoubtedly this is followed by many developers but it depend on the nature of the project. For common CRUD related database reliant application this may not be a wise option.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SR5YEBEQUoI/AAAAAAAAAtw/gk-rLftHv48/s1600-h/php_self.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 80px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SR5YEBEQUoI/AAAAAAAAAtw/gk-rLftHv48/s400/php_self.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268745440099062402" border="0" /></a><br /><h3>2. Code Generators:</h3>This will not be considered as an option my many. But if you have used Dreamweaver to generate code for your CRUD things you know how it functions. This option may be very helpful if you have less time and have to finish a college project just in a hurry to present it on the deadline. This option many generates code for insert, update and delete you manupulate it to your needs and you are done. But this will require you understand how the programming language works and you should have intermediate knowledge to edit it to fit your needs.<br /><br />Object generators can also help you in this. But for this the best opiton I&#8217;ve used (for my college projects) is Dreamweaver to generate some PHP fast and tailor the generated code to fit my requirements.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SR5ZC7itGqI/AAAAAAAAAt4/JsUgTLRp71k/s1600-h/DW_pog.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 80px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SR5ZC7itGqI/AAAAAAAAAt4/JsUgTLRp71k/s400/DW_pog.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268746520947923618" border="0" /></a><br /><h3>3. Framework (MVC):</h3>Wikipedia defines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework" target="_blank">software framework</a> as &#8220;A software framework, in computer programming, is an abstraction in which <span style="font-weight: bold;">common code</span> providing <span style="font-weight: bold;">generic functionality</span> can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code providing <span style="font-weight: bold;">specific functionality</span>.&#8221; The keywords have been made bold. So if you use a framework you don&#8217;t start from scratch and you have a base you build on.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller" target="_blank">Model View Controller (MVC)</a> is a design pattern which is a tried and tested paradigm for web development isolating business logic and presentation logic. Frameworks based on MVC are great for web development. PHP MVC frameworks that have proven their mettle are <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/" target="_blank">Code Igniter</a>, <a href="http://www.cakephp.org/" target="_blank">Cake PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/" target="_blank">Symphony </a>to name some.<br /><br />Using a framework enables you to have a separated business and presentation logic, standard code with convetions that leads to speed of developement and also facilitates maintenance on the long run. It will be your safest bet if you want to develop a web applicaiton with lots of CRUD. The avaibility of libraries and helpers, following DRY to the most will make your life easier.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SR5cDG5k7BI/AAAAAAAAAuA/VM5d7DICgvY/s1600-h/ci_cake.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 80px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SR5cDG5k7BI/AAAAAAAAAuA/VM5d7DICgvY/s400/ci_cake.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268749822531529746" border="0" /></a><br /><h3>4. Content Management System (CMS):</h3>Last but not the least option is using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank">Content Management System</a> (CMS) not only a CMS some CMS are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_framework" target="_blank">Content Management Framework</a> (CMF) like <a href="http://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a> and <a href="http://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla</a>. CMS lets you build websites in hours with not a single line of code to type. But you can also develop for a CMS.<br /><br />CMS are composed of modules and the featues you wish for are already available but if you have develop a custom module for yourself or even for others then you can do it as well. With the wealth of modules available it won&#8217;t be that you will need to develop a module but if you do, there are standards and rules to follow. Developing for CMS will surely improve your coding standard but head on module development may not be easy so start with something easy and get famility to the CMF frist.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SR5xZBiG94I/AAAAAAAAAuI/IJ5ggPgnYE4/s1600-h/drupal_joomla.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 80px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SR5xZBiG94I/AAAAAAAAAuI/IJ5ggPgnYE4/s400/drupal_joomla.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5268773288792225666" border="0" /></a><br />The selection of a method is heavily dependent on the the nature of the project being considered but do have a look at the above options. If you know any other way or have any comments, please comment.<br /><blockquote>On the whole, its a very wise option not to reinvent the wheel and to follow DRY- rule with MVC and other proven formulas to stay on top of your web development.</blockquote><br /><br />All the links related to this post available at <a href="http://delicious.com/geshan/100" target="_blank">http://delicious.com/geshan/100</a></div>

MTV India is without doubts one of the most popular and youth oriented music channel why don’t we have such a youth oriented music channel in our own country?<br /><br />After the ground breaking Jana Andolan 1 of the 1990, there was a burst of print media that broke the monopoly of Gorakhapatra then. We saw the advent of dailies like Kantipur and Nepal Samacharpatra and others to mark the commencement of democracy in Nepal. Similarly after the win of the people in Jana Andolan 2 in 2006, and the start of peace process we witnessed the dawn of News channels in Nepal with launch of Avenues TV and Sagarmatha TV around a year back.<br /><br />Recently a new news channel ABC (Accuracy Balance Credibility) has been added to the news channel bunch. They are doing a commendable job, hats off to all their valuable work and making people aware of different activates and educating people about various issues.<br /><br />Though Channel Nepal broke the monopoly of Nepal Television and the start of Image channel, Kantipur TV, Nepal 1 (not so Nepali channel) and NTV 2 Metro served news and entertainment in mixed proportions opened new doors, we are in need of a good music channel for sure. A news report claims there are twelve more channels in the pipeline.<br /><br />Some channels to hit our TV screens in near future are Namaste TV (entertainment and sports centered), Moonlight TV (Based on development journalism), Citizen TV, Everest TV and S.K TV to name some. But the problem is in this new changed situation of comparative peace and harmony there is not a single channel to promote Nepali music. A fully music centered channel that servers entertainment 24x7 has amazing business prospect, so why not MTV Nepal?<br /><br />Music Television is an American cable television network based in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, around sixty countries have their own MTV including India and China. So MTV Nepal could be a great music channel that gives the right entertainment and music dose to Nepal. MTV without arguments has revolutionized the music industry mainly the bond between youths, adolescents and MTV became strong with slogans like “Its My MTV” and the non musical programs being very youth oriented and things they can relate to very easily.<br /><br />MTV plays different genres of music but these days pop music and rap music have taken the main stream in world scenario. MTV has a long history of promoting social, political, and environmental activism in young people. So rather than watching a news and getting to the crux of the matter young people would like to know about political, social, environmental issues in more gullible form as provided by MTV. This will also help the development of the country.<br /><br />Our neighboring country India has around thirty music channels, with many regional ones but we till now have 3 news channels and not even a single entertainment and music focused channel. A music channel in many rights will help revive the slowing down music industry of our country. Yes there exists the problems of copyright and various other problems, there is no shortage of media in our country at this point in time but a music channel can be the cherry on the cake at this situation.<br /><br />Good products and services always stand out, if there are programs that support youth participation in our can be MTV Nepal then it will be a great success. Programs like MTV wassup, It’s my MTV, On the Job, Style Check will help to uplift the popularity of the channels among Nepali youth. Unbiased countdowns, truthful reviews, speedy event coverage presented in a short and punchy way will strike the right chords in the Nepali youth crowd. This does not mean there is less space for new ideas but the above programs will surely help to get the word out on MTV Nepal.<br /><br />There has not been any such program in the channels that air now where youth can really relate to. There are exceptional talk shows, sports shows that give good details but most lack viewer participation. On the other hand the channels have to compete with Indian and other channels which are in this business from years and we are just entering the TV zone, in this concern MTV India itself started twelve years back in 1996.<br /><br />Sahenndra Shrestha, executive producer at Image Channel, a veteran of Nepali music industry in his own right is in this industry from the past 15 years. Recollecting the days when he and other guys started Image’s program in 2053 B.S, they wanted to break the trend of music video shot only by Nepal Television then.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SRmZnLgoAVI/AAAAAAAAAtg/_uf4LedfsfU/s1600-h/Sahendra.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SRmZnLgoAVI/AAAAAAAAAtg/_uf4LedfsfU/s400/Sahendra.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267410137570083154" border="0" /></a><br />He sees a big need of a 24 hour music channel in Nepal and thinks youth oriented programs and channels can make a mark in this era. Currently producing programs like Music of Your Choice, SMS and More, Top of the Pops and Party central to name some, he adds “the feasibility and sustainability of a music channel will depend on marketing and advertisements.”<br /><br />“Like our program Music of Your Choice is being sponsored mainly by a multinational company Coke. If a new music channels have good sponsors who can support them then a 24 hour music channel will be very good.” He says a big yes to youth, music and entertainment focused channel for the future but has doubts about the return on initial investment. He visions this as a long term game where profit is sure but will take time,<br /><br />No doubts that is this political scenario News channels are watched most of the time. Youths like us who never switched on a news channel have started having a look at the latest news. This has led to more advertisement in news and the sponsors for entertainment and music programs have decreased in some form.<br /><br />Finally, I believe we are not in need of another News channel but we are in acute need of a music channel. It will put Nepali music in priority but also serve Indian and English music for the added advantage.  Let’s hope we get to watch MTV Nepal in near future.<br /><br />Geshan Manandhar</div>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
With the use of Digital cameras we have become more photo friendly and less camera shy. Now even mobiles have cameras so getting a picture of someone or catching that &#8220;must click&#8221; moment is just some steps away.<br /><br />There may be lots and lost of digital photos you take. After you take the photos you connect your USB cable and copy the photos to your laptop. I suggest keeping them in folders with year/month/date-you-took-those-photos folder for better organization of your photos. A simple example is given below:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SRhBcr5eVtI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/2CKIi9V4zpE/s1600-h/photo_categorization.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 272px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SRhBcr5eVtI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/2CKIi9V4zpE/s400/photo_categorization.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5267031725285725906" border="0" /></a><br /><br />After you have copied your photos to your laptop you can use various software to reduce the size and make the photos web and upload friendly. Like in above example I&#8217;ve folder like name_date_small that has the smaller version of the photos I snapped of 600x480 pixels which are small in size and very upload friendly.<br /><br />You may use your laptop to save and adjust photographs from your <a href="http://www.savebuckets.co.uk/browse/consumer-electronics/photography-film-video/digital-photography/digital-cameras/">digital camera</a>. SaveBuckets is a website I like that helps you find cheap <a href="http://www.savebuckets.co.uk/browse/computer-hardware/laptops/">laptops</a>. Savebuckets <a href="http://www.savebuckets.co.uk/">price comparison</a> website helps find the best prices for laptops. Compare prices for leading brands including Acer, HP, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba laptop computers. They have a good price comparision and a wide variety to choose from. Get your <a href="http://www.savebuckets.co.uk/browse/computer-hardware/laptops/">laptop</a> from them.<br /><br /><blockquote>Next time you snap some pictures do save them in appropriate folders so you get them when you need them.</blockquote></div>

Searching for some web host reviews I ran into <a href="http://www.webhostingpal.com/">Web Hosting Pal</a>. It is guide to finding web hosts that fits your budget which can even be less than $5 a month which offers PHP &amp; MySQL, Unix, Windows and FrontPage.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SRGyYafWs3I/AAAAAAAAAtI/0ASvxvqkFNY/s1600-h/web_hosting_pal.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px; height: 400px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SRGyYafWs3I/AAAAAAAAAtI/0ASvxvqkFNY/s400/web_hosting_pal.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265185571870258034" border="0" /></a>The website lists the top 10 web hosts in the homepage which is very helpful and appropriate listing of the price per month, web space and bandwidth provided. These are the three main things we look in a web host on the first go.<br /><br />You can also browser through the hosts listed for your e-commerce web application with CPanel and PayPal option if you want to sell products or services from your website. The data provided in Webhostingpal.com includes all the features the web host provides.<br /><br />The beginner&#8217;s guide page has described the currency, cost in cycles, plan features, e-mail features and others in the right way and explanation is also easy to understand.<br /><br />The top 10 page has the top 10 hosts listed. And the review of the hosts is either an internal link or links to an external review. The review of a host has sections like overview, features, customer support, highlight, disadvantage and our advice. In the left side the tabular presentation of needed services and their description make it easier to select the host. This gives a good idea on how the host will function and will it meet the client&#8217;s need or not.<br /><br />The reviews provided are realistic and reader friendly. I have used Bluehost and I know why it deserves the top spot. I&#8217;ve seen Bluehost at top at other review sites too. In the reviews the highlight segment and customer support are good to have a read.<br /><br />The website has a minimal design with use of colors only no images except logo. On the contrary it still is able to present the information needed in a readable fashion. But still the website can better in the design and can still provide more extensive reviews with user comments.<br /><br /><blockquote>All in all it is a good site to look at if you are looking for a web host. It may not have the widest range of hosts listed but it has not missed out the good ones. Before buying your web space have a look at <a href="http://www.webhostingpal.com/">Web Hosting Pal</a>.</blockquote></div>
