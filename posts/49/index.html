This seems to an over statement in current milieu but it may not be distant dream. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) association is a <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region></st1:place> based non-profit organization set up to oversee “The Children&#8217;s Machine” project and the construction of the 2B1 (laptop model) &#8220;$100 laptop&#8221; converts to around 7 thousand 5 hundred NC. Both the project and the organization were announced at the World Economic Forum in <st1:place st="on"><st1:city st="on">Davos</st1:city>, <st1:country-region st="on">Switzerland</st1:country-region></st1:place> in January 2005. The organization gained its most attention after Nicholas Negroponte (the founding chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s Media Lab) and Kofi Annan unveiled a working prototype of the ‘CM1’ (another laptop model) in November 2005 at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, Tunisia. The whole project is the brain child of Mr. Negroponte.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="">   </span>This novel plan to develop a 100 dollar laptop and distribution to millions of school children of developing countries has caught the interest of governments and attention of many computer industry heavyweights. Some heavyweights supporting this praiseworthy causer are Google, Red Hat, AMD, Brightstar Corporation, News Corporation and Nortel Networks. Each company has donated two million dollars. The MIT Media Lab is also involved in the project.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>So, what is OLPC then? OLPC is a program to enable all children, everywhere, to have the best education possible. Creating and distributing inexpensive laptops will allow students to become more active and creative, letting them take their learning beyond the walls of their schools and off the pages of textbooks. These $100 laptops will serve as libraries, music studios, art galleries and communications devices, using an open-source software platform that the students can customize and expand as their learning needs and programming skills grow. These machines will permit students to move beyond static, information-centric views of computing and learning by providing a vehicle for experimentation and collaboration. All in all it will teach students how to learn from a wider perspective.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>Although no contracts with governments have been signed, Mr. Negroponte says current plans call for producing five to ten million units beginning in late 2006 or early 2007, with tens of millions more a year later. As from the map in the official website (http://laptop.org) <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region> lies in yellow category that specifies those countries which are currently seeking government support. Therefore in the context of <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region> we can encourage this project as it will uplift the education status of the whole nation. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>The Nepali localization of the OLPC project is “Mero Sanu Sathi”. Mero Sanu Sathi is the name given to the laptop that may be distributed to the school children of <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It is not a technical project but an educational project which is of the child not for the child. This is the best way to revitalize and revolutionize our education system that runs at the pace of a tortoise. It does not teach the child but make them learn learning. We haven’t seen any government interest in this topic till date but some NGO’s and INGOs are warming up for this worthy initiative. Interested organizations in Nepal for implementation of this project include FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) Nepal Communtiy, Nepal Engineering College (NEC), UNDP, United Mission to Nepal, Education Network Nepal, Bellanet Asia/SAP International,<span style="">   </span>Curriculum Development Center,<span style="">   </span>IT- Resource Nepal (For More see http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Nepal) . But in these sorts of project government help and support is critical. The non government and private organization cannot make this kind of project reality. So I urge government and all concerned parties to support this noble cause.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>So may be in five to ten years the children going to school in <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region></st1:place> may be saying “Mummy mero saanu sathi ko battery sakiyo, charge garidinu na hai.”</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p><br />About 650 Words<o:p></o:p></span></p></div>

I had contributed an article for that mag in the past. I work till 1 AM to jot down the questions to ask the ever popular young and energetic band whose life performance I witnessed just two days back on 16<sup>th</sup> December 2006. I am a fan of jal for that matter.     <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            The day arrives, in the morning I’m informed to reach the parking of Hyatt at 10. I reach there on time, thing to consider is that I have an exam (viva) to give at 11:30 or 12:00. There seems to a miscommunication but we are informed that Jal has gone for a mountain flight. To no avail, we wait for an hour or so. Then the Jal’s manager inform us they are coming. He meant that they are coming down from their room but we scanned every incoming vehicle to sum up the work. Then Jal’s manager was behaving so good with us.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            After around two hours of endless waiting, the terrific trio of Jal finally arrive at the lobby of Hyatt. I run to the lead vocalist Salman Butt and ask him to give me few minutes. Goher is a litter far and Shazi is in his own world. Just as I begin to ask the first question the chameleon nature of the manager shows, he is so eager to move. Informs me that they are getting late. He had ensured that he will provide 10 minutes or so but I had to sum up the interview in just 1:45 mins with just two questions asked. I was so unsatisfied as my hard work was unjustified and I still had a exam to give. Another point to notice is that Mr. Butt didn’t feel the need to stop smoking while answering my question. Do you call this Jal (Manger mainly)’s disrespect to media or what? I really wished that they missed their flight!!!! A ray of hope they had the decency to wave us bye.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            The next day I get the anchor story of THT(The Himalayan Times) that ‘Jal’s manager is held with illegal notes’ I was so happy. Let’s put it aside but I’m a big fan of Jal. The way they treated a media person was reprehensible. If they had told they won’t give the interview we could have returned, they didn’t value our time. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            Nonetheless, today 27<sup>th</sup> December 2006 I again get a call when I’m returning home from college. I just find out that I have to interview the creative genius behind Jal – Goher Mumtaz only as others have returned and Manager is still in custody. I was per-informed about this so I had prepared the questions; I jump home print the question and head for the interview at 6. Reach a hotel at Jwalakhel and landed in Goher Mumtaz’s room. He was watching cricket at that time. This man is truly talented no doubts about that as he is the lyricist, lead and rhythm guitarist and above all composes the songs for Jal. Buts still on the contrary to my bitter experience 9 days back he is down to earth and humble. Primarily, the interview as very good, I have recorded it. He did smoke but had the decorum to blow the smoke away from me. A fine-looking tall gifted artist being perplexed by my question was what I enjoyed the most in today’s interview. All in all I must add you must set aside the emotion and feelings in professional life to a level, or it forbids you from giving your best shot. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">         <br />          This was the bitter and sweet experience I had with interviewing Jal. Hope it was likable. If I get the photos I’ll add them up.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p><br />Geshan Manandhar</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Around 650 Words</div></div></div>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RhCyDH5Rk9I/AAAAAAAAABo/W2pIrk3xGMU/s1600-h/925071447-5524104-1.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RhCyDH5Rk9I/AAAAAAAAABo/W2pIrk3xGMU/s320/925071447-5524104-1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5048730949010953170" border="0" /></a><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">         </span><span style=""></span>When I first heard “Chakna Chakna” on the TV promo I was thinking Himesh Reshammiya is appearing in the limelight after a while and his comeback is so lame. Then after hearing the full song and its remix I was satisfied with his doings. People who don’t keep up to their words are hypocrites so Reshammiya time and again told he will never act but his multi million project “Aap ka suroor” will hit theaters in some months I guess. Criticism apart lets scrutinize the album NamasteY London, why is the y there I don’t know. When I found out that Namastey London was an album with 18 tracks a 2 disk collection I thought I would never review it. The promos were scintillating so I decided to watch the move and it was ok but the music really excited me. The crux of the matter is there are only 7 tracks which as remixes and a new experiment by the maestro Mehfil mix with the legendary lyricist and poet Javed Akhtar reciting some lines himself. So all the lyrics are written by Javed Akhtar, music without doubts is by Himesh, remixes arranged by DJ Akbar Sami with rap by Arya. Cover informs the songs are recorded by Aamir Shaikh. The album is released and marketed by Eros music as film is under the banner of Eros Entertainment, it has all the codes for the ringtones and singtones you’ll need for a musical cell phone. </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>Ok now to the album, the cover is an eye candy. With enough information and being well versed the cover goes in sync with the whole album. The inlays has middle parted pictures of the two lead actors which seems nice, both disks are printed are printed with <u>same picture depicting the patriotic feeling that the film effervescently carries</u>. Lets <i style="">scrutinize the music of this elaborate album and put the 18 numbers under the scanner</i>. The album kicks off with the songs we first heard in the promos <b style="">“Chakna Chakna”</b> the guru himself as usual has sung this song. Lyrics are to the mark but the music seems unconvincing. Still Himesh relies on the 4/4 techno beats but the percussion does have that let’s dance effect on it. The <u>funjabi song with lyrics that depict love is misplaced in the bar</u>. Consequently, again it’s Reshammiya the singer trying to sing <b style="">“Viraaniya”.</b> This song has heartfelt tragic lyrics. Melody goes with the flow, the use of violin is formidable but at times you think the percussion is more than needed. Next we have <b style="">“Main Jahan Rahoon”</b> simply <u>my favorite track</u> of this compilation. It is amazingly executed by “<u>Rahat Fateh Ali Khan</u> and <st1:place st="on">Krishna</st1:place>”. Rahat the Pakistani music marvel has lent his voice to astonishing numbers like <i style="">“Lagan Lagi- Paap” and “Jiya Dhadak – Kalyug</i>”. The film kicks off with the remix version of this track I wanted it to be a love song but it turned out to be a patriotic one. Nevertheless, the music of the song is addictive; the balance between rhythm, melody and percussion is impressive. The singer scores on all grounds. About the lyrics, it can be said it depicts lots of love but for the country.<span style="">  </span></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p><br /><span style="">            </span>Subsequent track on the list Track 4 of disc 1 is <b style="">“Yahi Hota Pyar”</b><span style="">  </span>by <u>Himesh and Sunidhi Chauhan</u>. Lyric of this song are incredible focusing that love never looses hope. The singers have uttered the lyric in a remarkable fashion. Music of the song seems slow but goes very well with the theme of the song. One octave low but Himesh has proved his metal in different octaves. Following it we have <b style="">“Rafta Rafta” </b>it is credited to <u>R D B</u>. The song is well vocalized by the singers, it says Rafta Rafta but the words are uttered at a fast tempo. Music is the <u>regular Himesh techno theme</u> dance track kind but as the lyrics demands it has the earthy feel to it. The shortest song amongst the lot it measures 4:44. Next is “<b style="">Aanan Faanan”</b> it is astoundingly vocalized by <u>Jayesh Gandhi and Akriti Kakkar</u>. <u>Jayesh</u> has the popular track “<i style="">Ishq Ne- Ahista Ahista</i>” under his belt and Akriti has sung many tracks for and with Reshammyia. The songs has up beat lyrics, now <u>typical Himesh music is heard with the hard hitting beats and melody woven together</u>. Lyric of this is <i style="">change focused with all the things that change</i> in the film. The last real track of the album is “<b style="">Dilruba</b>”, it is effervescently sung by <u>Zubeen Garg and Alisha Chinai</u>. If I write about Alisha Chinai it will be never enough but <b style="">Zubeen</b> I noticed from “”Jane Kya – Pyar Ke side Effects” from then he <u>has lent his voice to many hip numbers</u>. He has a <u>narcotic voice</u> that goes inline with the song. The song has a romantic lyric but the music is in vogue and dance friendly. Reversely the <u>use of violin here also had added the extra zing to this song</u>. Again this songs also is placed in a club setting the <b style="">song’s lyrics is facing East and the song’s visualization is facing West</b>. Reshammiya still stick with the never fail formula of DJ friendly songs, which will be a hit if not they will be played loud in the discos because DJs will remix it what so ever. At track 8 and 9 of Disc 1 we come across <b style="">“Viraaniya Mehfil Mix”</b> and <b style="">“Aanan Fanan Mehfil Mix”, </b>Mehfil mixes are not that different mixes of the original they just have <u>Javed Akhter uttering some lines of his poems at the beginning and in the middle</u> as well and <u>more conventional instruments are added in the songs like the tabla</u> so I’ll skip the detail description of these tracks. On the contrary I’ll try to elaborate what I feel about the <b style="">remixes</b>. </p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>Jumping to Disc 2 now at the 10<sup>th</sup> track of the album the track 1 of 2<sup>nd</sup> disc, we stumble upon <b style="">“Chakna Chakna Remix”</b> I have had always liked the remixes of Himesh’s tracks that also mainly done by DJ Akbar Sami. DJ Sami has remixed all the tracks including this one. This particular <u>track is peculiar; it seems like a dhol mix</u> in the beginning but has mixed flavors as you go into it further. Well, it’s a dance floor oriented track and must listen to all party goers. Next track on the list is <b style="">“Dilruba Remix”, </b>without respecting the lyrics the song has been remixed relentlessly. The rap by Arya stand out here and “Namastey London” is also audible at places. The remix is very in vogue and is all set to make your heart beat racing. The <u>4/4 beats go very well with the hitting percussions</u> utilized to remix this song. Subsequently, <b style="">“Main Jahan Rahoon Remix” </b>comes in the list. It has been amazingly remixed by the DJ. Keeping the feelings of the song intact the song has a haunting effect when remixed but the DJ has done a formidable job. </p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;">Next is <b style="">“Yahi Hota Hai Pyar Remix”</b>, this is also a stereotype club mix. It has the building beats and all the synthetic sounds that make you wanna shake a leg. “<b style="">Aanan Faanan Remix</b>” stands consequent to the previous number, distinctly this song has fade in and fade out of the voice. The <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">Congo</st1:country-region></st1:place> beats really stand out in the songs, without doubts this song can set the club on fire. Next is <b style="">“Main Jahan Rahoon Mehfil Mix” and “Yahi Hota Hai Pyar Mehfil Mix”</b> that is similar to the above Mehfil mixes. Then we have a punchy remix <b style="">“Viraaniya Remix”</b>, it seems the frustration projected in the lyrics has been transformed as the beats in the songs. The percussion really hits you hard in this song that implies it will give you the kick to dance your head off. Now with all this dancing you’ll be tired, last but not the least you have <b style="">“Rafta Rafta Remix”</b> to handle. Still <b style="">saying Rafta Rafta you put your hands up and start dancing</b> to his fast paced gripping track. Remarkably remixed, this track consists of all the elements for a hit Remix track.</p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">All in all, the album is a good deal for anyone who wants a party album, a slow musical or a regular Reshammiya compilation. The <b style="">compositions range from tragic, romantic, patriotic to dance track</b> so it well be able to satisfy a diverse range of audience. Most <u>songs are long over 5 minutes</u> that gets to your nerves at times. If you think Reshammiya has made a bad come back listen to the album else if you sense he has made a good come back this will be in you music collection for sure. </p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><u><o:p><span style="text-decoration: none;"> </span></o:p></u></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><u>Around 1450 Words (With title)<o:p></o:p></u></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">Longest Album Review I’ve ever written as it has 18 Tracks.</p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">I haven’t provided description of the Mehfil mixes but to make it comprehensive I’ve given added information of the singers. </p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><u>Comments welcome.<o:p></o:p></u></p> <div style="text-align: justify;">  </div> <p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p></b></p></div>

With a sound system of sixty eight thousand watt capacity and dazzling lights placed in by Nepa-Sa, it was sure that the concert would go till dusk. Stated to start at 2:30 PM but the concert got underway only at around 3:30 PM. The hosts Suraj Singh Tahkuri and Mahima Bhattarai were trying to start a competition between Pakistani and Nepali makura. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Then at around 3:45 PM Steam Injuns finally appeared on the stage. Singing around 7 of their popular songs the cool band with a beautiful and talented lady did set the mood for a rocking concert. Consequently X-mantra appeared on the stage at around 4:15 PM. They also had about half a dozen of their popular tracks to offer.<span style="">  </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Finally the people were about to get what they had paid for, Strings first time Live in <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It was already 5:15 PM and the sound checks and setting up the instrument and equipment just started. In quest for the impeccable sound the equipment setup ate up much of the valuable time. The crowd was getting impulsive and curious to hear their favorite Pakistani band without any delay. After all the hustle and bustle, the dynamic duo of Strings ultimately emerged on stage. The crowd roared to the talented Pakistani fiery duo. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Strings started their rocking performance at 6 PM with Chhaye Chhaye from their last album Dhaani, a great rock based track well vocalized by the vocalist, Faisal Kapadia. After it Anjane Kyon (Dekha Tujhe) from Duur charged the crowd with the amazing voice of Bilal Maqsood reacing their ears. Subsequently, the ever popular Na Jane Kyon, OST of Spiderman 2 was sung by Karachi-based band Strings with emotion provoking charisma. People in the crowd couldn’t stop waving their hands to the mesmerizing melody of the song. The crowd followed blindly what ever Kapadia asked them to do. The sight when people were waving their cell phones in air in the twilight was a sight to remember. It was amazing to witness the boys shouting their lungs out in the lyrics of Anjane Kyon.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>After it a relatively old song called Ja Raha was performed by the talented duo. The mixing of Purani Jeans in the middle by Faisal was incredible. Amazingly the crowd response was extraordinary though it had started getting dark but people didn’t stop jumping. The last song was Sar Kiyae an old song from their album Strings2 the song that made them popular initially. It was very unfortunate that the rain gods showered the untimely drizzle and the performance had to be stopped at around 6:45 PM due to technical difficulties. In just minutes the drizzle turned into a heavy downpour but the performance by Strings was an improbable experience. The crowd was not satisfied as they hoped to witness the performance of great tracks like Dhaani, Duur, Soniye, Kahani Mohobatt Ki and others. <span style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Strings is a very popular band in <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region></st1:place> as well. They have been voted the most popular Pakistani band in <st1:place st="on">Asia</st1:place>, they received the award of most favorite band award in MTV Asia Awards 2005. The two-man band, comprising vocalist Faisal Kapadia and guitarist Bilal Maqsood are the national ambassadors for HIV-AIDS in <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> set by UNICEF. Faisal the lead vocalist of strings was born on 29th June 1970<span style="color: rgb(90, 90, 90);font-family:Verdana;font-size:7;"  >.</span> Placing aside his family business he states “I always used music as a tool to escape the Monotony of numbers.“ He always aspired to be in a band. Similarly Bilal Maqsood the guitarist and back vocalist of strings was born on 23rd March 1971. Son of a writer he states “I never thought I&#8217;d take up music as my sole profession”. Bilal the brain of Strings owns a very soothing voice and is listed as one of the best guitarist of <st1:place st="on">Asia</st1:place>.<br /><span style="">            </span>The band was formed way back in 1989 with four guys Faisal, Bilal with two other friends including Rafiq (Who did keyboards and composing then). <span style=""> </span>The four man band released two albums Stings in 1990 and Strings 2 in 1992 but as usual the band broke up… Sar Kiyae Yeh Pahar from Strings 2 was the song to make Strings a household name. The members went to US for further study, two of them were busy in their own professional fields but the energetic duo of Faisal and Bilal wanted to tryout their creative juices. So they decided to reform the band as they completed their bachelors, but after a decade only two of them could make it out of the regular busy life. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>In 2002, the album Duur was released by the reformed two man Strings. Instantly the title track was a big hit. <st1:place st="on"><st1:state st="on">Maine</st1:state></st1:place> tujhe and Sar Kiya Yeh Pahar were two of the popular tracks then Now restricting their composition to a more slow rock pop base the band’s popularity gradually begin to rise. In 2004 they hit the market with Dhaani. Again the title track with the video did the trick. The album was very popular. When their song “Najane Kyon” got selected as an OST for the hollywood movie ‘Spiderman 2’, their fan following expanded to a worldwide form. The song though being in urdu was in sync with the movie. Almost all the songs were visualized and all of them were musical gems. Among the songs Soniye, Chhaye Chhaye and Bolo bolo feat. Hari Haran were just outstanding. Other projects they got involved in were Jeet Lo Dil with Indian band Euphoria in 2004, It was the official song for the Phillips Indo Pak Cricket Series held in <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>. In 2006, they sang two numbers for a hindi moive called Zinda. Both songs were composed by Bilal and both had been remixed by DJ and VJ Nikhil of MTV. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>With 5 albums and some amazing projects the band’s popularity has rose up in the last few years. Bagging around twenty five videos under their belt, Strings is the ultimate king of melody, rock and soothing sound mixed for a total satisfying experience. The two guys share a unique chemistry as they have been together for the last 15 years. These guys have performed almost all round the world and were trying to be in <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region> to perform from the last three years. Conclusively it was a short but a rocking performance by the brisk, talented and melodious Strings which was cut off by the untimely rain.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar (Around 1025 words)</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the longest things I&#8217;ve ever written.

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Multitalented Denil Chitrakar was born on 26 Jestha, 2039 at Bharatpur, Chitwan. Son of a lok song singer Sunil Chitrakar, he has been arranging songs from 2056 BS and till now this has arranged around 60 songs. He has come out with his album khubi which has xx number of songs, which he claims he was able to compile in just 4 months. Basically, the album falls in the pop genre so it has not limitation in the audience aspect. Among his own songs he likes “kina  chhadyou” the most as it is a slow song and has a hum able melody. He claims that his album is distinct from others as he himself has done all the work for the album and his work is orginal. This multifaceted personality is able to compose, arrange and sing as well. He is also interested in dancing, as a kid he was very fond of Michael Jackson’s dance steps and tried imitating the king of pop. Amazingly, he can even do animation. Fact of the matter is he has himself designed the cover for his album.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Denil liked listening to Narayan Gopal as he grew up. He also admires Nepathya, Sanjay Shrestha and Karna Das in the recent times. We can say that music runs in his blood, his grandfather Mr. Nil Bahadur Chitrakar was a classical singer, his father Mr. Sunil Chitrakar used to sing folk songs at Radio <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Then his father also tried his hands on modern songs. His life is like a journey. Born in Bharatpur, he did his schooling at Biratnagar and then arrived to <st1:place st="on">Kathmandu</st1:place> in 2052 BS. His first recorded song happens to be “Mero Sapana Bhitra” when he was in grade 10. He has ten years of working experience in Nepali music scene and he truly opposed the concept of music piracy. He believes that currently in our country a singer cannot sustain his life by just singing but also blames the pirates who pirate music for this situation. He argues that if one listener likes a song s/he should buy the original CD for the promotion of the artist and respect the creation and hardwork of the artist. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            He informs that he didn’t have to go through a struggling period as he used to arrange songs for other artists. He adds that working for the album was a secret until it came out as he used to spend hours on his computer. After completion of the album, he just approached two companies and among the two Situ Digital liked the songs and accepted to market it. He also shares he has had a very good experience with Nepali media. The FM stations have played his songs so as to promote new artist. His first video “Sundari” is also enjoying good air play. He notifies that he has achieved admirable response from our mass media. He also shares that he had a learning experience shooting the video of “Sundari”. He is thankful to his friends Bandhu Adhikari and Ram Kumar for helping whim with the lyrics of some songs of his album.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            In future he tells that he has another video in the pipeline for his song “Kina Chhadyou”. He enlightens that he is not considered a professional singer or an animator. Being very much interested in animation since childhood this arranger turned singer also wants to try his hands in professional animation. He is currently studying Maya at MACC. We wish him more success.
