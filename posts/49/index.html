It’s a small and very handy phone with many the features. Being a Nokia product it emphasizes on user friendliness.<span style="">  </span>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Undoubtedly, it has very good sound quality. The reception of signals is also fine. The battery life is also satisfactory. The best thing about this phone is that it’s small and very well designed. Just fits in my palm and easy to operate. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Only one game is available chess puzzle when you buy it. It supports USB connection to a computer via a data cable from which you can transfer data is that given space of 256 Kb for polyphonic midi ring tones, pictures and application (games).<span style="">  </span>The organizer is also a handy tool to use; I have many day notes and remainder for jobs. Writing messages is also easy. Alarm clock, calculator comes in very useful. This GPRS (Global Packet Radio Service) enabled phone give me comprehensive access to the internet on need. I am addicted to changing the wallpaper and ring tone almost daily.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">The point I am not satisfied with is that it instantly stores the numbers in phone memory. Other than that the 8 channel midi ring tone playback is also somewhat lame. Though a color mobile, but the display is not up to the mark as it is 256 color display. Playing graphic intensive games on this phone is not that satisfying. It says it has infrared but I don’t know the service point in the phone. If anyone knows please inform me. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">All in all, the phone is a must have for the person who wants a color mobile without extra features associated with a camera. If you don’t want a feature rich phone with mp3 player, FM, sound recording and video recording this is the best color mobile for you. I find more pros then cons in this model. It is really value for money, after it’s a Nokia product, which connects people. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Around 350 Words</p><p class="MsoNormal"> It was written in June 2006, so may be a not that proficient in use of language.<br /></p></div>

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RgP2Y9lXWWI/AAAAAAAAABA/pqsL9cSPrZk/s1600-h/platina_GM.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RgP2Y9lXWWI/AAAAAAAAABA/pqsL9cSPrZk/s320/platina_GM.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5045146916293663074" border="0" /></a>After an intensive research in the 100 CC segment I had to opt for Bajaj Platina. Why you’ll find it later. The great contenders included some models from TVS, Hero Honda, LML which may even fall in the 125 CC class but I had to choose a cool bike with great mileage. As the advertisement states it has killer looks and the style with 108 KMPL fuel efficiency. It states 108 KMPL but currently in the first month has given only 50-60 KMPL, it was stated by the company that it will give only upto 55 KMPL before the first servicing. I have rode 600 KMs in about a month, I really want to witness how it performs overtime.   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>The killer looks include premium alloy wheels, matt finished black silencer, sporty console, sleek chrome graphics, graphite tinted engine and transmission and chrome streaked side panels. With the new exhaus-TEC engine it is bound to perform well. The SNS suspension does give you a great riding pleasure. The handling and braking is very good in this brand new stage but it will be tested as the time passes. From almost all angles the bike resembles Wind 125 but has no self start like the Discover. It does make heads turn but if it had a self start it would have been a complete bike. I assume it’s built on the old caliber engine which has power for sure but does make the irritating gear shift sounds.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>With a tank capacity of 13 liters I’m freed from going to the petrol pump almost every alternate day as I used to ride the <st1:street st="on"><st1:address st="on">Hero Honda Street</st1:address></st1:street> Smart with tank capacity of just 3.5 liters I suppose. It has a mild sound not like the bold sounds of the Hero Honda model’s but doesn’t lack the always needed pickup and speed. The first gear is very powerful, but again clutch balance is what I didn’t learn easily on this machine. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Small things to consider, the rubber pad on foot brake is a very good small addition that caught my attention. The ride control on/off does work, it can be used to shift from economy and power mode formidably. The leg guard is very primitive so it had to be upgraded. Again the gear shifting makes lots of noise, the chain cover also emits unneeded noise. The gear shifting lever is pushed inside, which leads to the plastic styling being scratched by the shoes when gears are changed. The kick is regular L shaped which is easy to kick rather that the C shaped kick we find in Discover, but it should not affect as discover has self start. The side lamps as of all the Bajaj models are over stretched, looks very good but is prone to breakage. Tyres have no such defect till date; the ride experience on the whole is a good one.<span style="">  </span>Reading above paragraph you might think I regret the decision of buying this baby, but not I’m a very good critic as people say. The price of one lakh two thousand Nepali currency (equate to Rs. 63750 IC, which you people can get in a lot cheaper now at Rs 34000 IC, its very expensive here in Kathmandu, Nepal because of all the taxes) is well set for this motorbike. I love the alloy wheels and the bike’s performance even in busy roads. The bike has good speed when it comes to riding in the open roads. I have traveled around 60 KMs in a single day but the bike showed no sighs of slowing down which I liked, I know it is also because it is new. <st1:place st="on">Battery</st1:place> is also performing standard though I have put this bike under the rain few times but it hasn’t given any trouble. The side lamps switch is hip to operate, the key cover in ignition and fuel tank is logical. The oil indictor under the engine is a feature that is unique to this model. The horn also sound ok, it is not too sharp and irritating like that of the Pulsar or Discover.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Overall the bike has no such features like self start, disc brakes but for a bike priced right with 108 KMPL it is the best option you can get in the market. </p>  Geshan Manandhar<br />Around 725 Words</div>

Starting off in a desert and train scenario it ends up in… wait, what’s the fun if I tell you how it ends. Shot is various locations like Brazil, Nambia’s Desert, Mumbai, an old for in India etc this film has amazingly projected the two curvaceous beauties Aish and Bips in a glamorous manner.   </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Coming to the guys <b>Hrithik is simply the best in this movie</b>. He is the style guru with no doubts, acts like a veteran and gives action sequences as it was a piece of cake. Abhishek has an amusing entry as per me and acts well but seems a little bossy at times as his character. Uday is similar to the last Dhoom but his character has <b>added the zing of comedy</b> in this intense but still in vogue movie. There are no such supporting actors who stand out as the film revolves mainly on the leading 5. Rimi Sen puts of a good show in her small role. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            The good points about the film can be tagged as <b>the technical work</b>. The <b>camera has been handled by an experienced person</b> the <b>editor also has magic in his hands</b>. Some camera angles in the breath taking locations are out of this world. Equally the <b>actors have also provided a formidable act</b>. The <b>background music by Salim-Sulemaan is the icing on the cake;</b> do have to tell anything about the <b>music by Pritam its</b> <b>just pulsating</b>. The <b>screenplay is also up to the mark</b> while the ending could have been much better, I sense there is a space left for Dhoom3 as well. <b>Choreography  Viavhabi Merchant is also astounding</b>, Hrithik is a fabulous dancer but Aish dances great when she is alone in the video with Hrithik she loose her composure aplomb. My favourite scene is the one with Hrithik, Aish and the gun.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Now the things I consider not that good in the film. The special effects is the first thing I want to include this list. I say <b>special effect is like a drug, best when you know how much and when to use it</b>. I don’t complain that the special effects are bad but at some point it <b>seems very unrealistic and kind of unnecessary</b>. About the actors <b>Bipasha lacks the poise</b> in some shots and in “touch me” the song. <b>Aish is looking skinny</b> in most part of the film but looks portly at the end, portly because she looks a little fat than regular. <b>Uday Chopra over acts</b> at some stages and <b>Jr. Bachan should have been built</b> <b>regarding his physique</b> for a role like this but he is OK. The only cool guy in this gang is Hrithik, he is just impeccable. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Now writing about the clothes, style, the gadgets including bikes and cars. The chopper looks very real in film just joking. All the stars are shining brighter just due to the skillful stylist. Everyone has dream to get clothes on them. Here also <b>Hrithik</b> steals the show, I read that <b>he as 17 looks in the film</b>. I haven’t counted but his disguises are simply flawless and so in sync with the movie. Other actors also put up a good show regarding style and carrying it off. <b>Gadgets are cool </b>as in the previous version. To a level it seems you are overdoing with the gadgets but the bike race in the end is sure to thrill you. Oh did I let something out already. For more detail information run to a theater near you.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            To sum up, this movie if better than Dhoom. In simple words a paisa wasool movie and a must watch in the theater. <b>Grab your friends and let the reel roll</b>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Around 675 Words</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Can be found at <a href="http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Dhoom_2-114905-1.html">http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Dhoom_2-114905-1.html</a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br /></div></div></div>

The cover design is relevant and revealing the back cover even gives the artists who have played instruments, programmed songs etc in the album which is <b style="">different as well as respectful</b> to the artists behind the curtain. The mix of blue, pink and brown for <b style="">Sea, Love and Sand</b> is impressive on the covers. The fun conveying snaps of the jodis with the signature bus in the cover and inlay covers of the CD is articulate. The <i style="">six jodis on the cover remind us of a recent film</i> but here the married percent is cent percent.  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Album kicks off with the first aired song entitled <b style="">“Sajna Ji Wari Wari”</b> which is sung by <i style="">Sunidhi Chauhan</i> mainly and <i style="">Shekhar Ravjiani’s</i> name is also visible in the color. Capivating techno beats seamlessly blended with <u>conventional instrumentation</u> with formidable lyric makes this song <u>stick to your head and your mouth</u> from the word go. It’s a short song but has the punch to put you down in one listen. Subsequently, we get to enchant our ears with <b style="">“Jaane Hai Woh Kahan”</b> which portrays the vocal skills of the talented <i style="">Shreya Ghosal</i> and effervescent <i style="">Shaan</i>. The use of <u>synthetic percussion and regular instruments</u> has added the extra zing to the song which already has a commendable lyric by <b style="">Javed Akhtar</b>. Akhtar has inked the lyrics of all the songs in this album. Next on the list is <b style="">“Albela Albela”</b> which is executed by Mr. Breathless himself <i style="">Shankar Mahadevan</i> and <i style="">Vishal Dadlani</i> with elegance. The rap back vocal supports the song’s dance feel. The <u>lyric is amazing</u> and the song on the whole makes you want to <u>jump on the dance floor</u>. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>At track 4 the sweet music of guitar runs down the ear with the song <b style="">“Halke Halke”</b>. This emotion provoking lyric of this track is vocalized by <i style="">Neeraj Sridhar</i> from the Bombay Vikings fame. The singer has <u>uttered the words with grace</u>. The music is simple and very easy to the ears. <u>Melody grips your heart effortlessly</u> and the upbeat instrumentation is simply astounding. Consequently <i style="">Sunidhi Chauhan</i> and <i style="">Gayatri Iyer</i> have amazingly executed the song titled <b style="">“Pyaar Ki Ek Kahani”</b>. The salsa type music makes you <u>want to shake a leg</u>. The <u>earthy but powerful lyric goes in sync with the will to do tango</u> in the jive. After it we have <b style="">“Haath Dhore Niye Chalo”</b> which has a Bengali title I suppose. This is an <u>instrumental track</u> to be more precise produced by Funcinternational. This has all the <u>qualities of a techo/ house type music with the typical 4/4 beats</u>. The words in the beginning and some parts of the music make it ideal choice for a background piece and a good track to end the party in style. Last but not the least, we have <b style="">“Halke Halke Remix”</b> by <u>Neeraj Sridhar</u> again. This time the <u>tempo has been increased and significant amount of percussive beats</u> have been added. This is a dance floor friendly track for sure. <span style=""> </span><span style=""> </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>All in all, this is a good effort by Vishal-Shekhar which I sense goes comfortably in sync with the movie. There are just above half a dozen tracks with one remix and one instrumental but most of the tracks are dance numbers which is fun. <b style=""><u>Variety in similarity</u></b> is highlighted by the dynamic duo in this album. If <u>you have liked prior album by the music director duo then you can be missing something if you don’t have this album</u> till date.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 204, 0);" class="MsoNormal">Geshan Manandhar</p>  <p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal">Around 625 Words</p>  Also posted on Mouthshut.com at <a href="http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Honeymoon_Travels_Pvt_Ltd-119776-1.html">http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Honeymoon_Travels_Pvt_Ltd-119776-1.html </a><br />From the name of System_Shadow but Written by Me.<br />For more see:<br /><a href="http://www.mouthshut.com/user/system_shadow/1.html">http://www.mouthshut.com/user/system_shadow/1.html</a></div>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
This got published in ShowBIz Magazine, Nov 06 ISsue<br /><br /> OLPC, is it a distant dream?<br /><br />Imagine a day when Nepali school kids will ask their mothers to recharge the battery for their laptops. This seems to an over statement in current milieu but it may not be distant dream.<br /><br />One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) association is a U.S. based non-profit organization set up to oversee “The Children&#8217;s Machine” project and the construction of the 2B1 (laptop model) &#8220;$100 laptop&#8221; converts to around 7 thousand 5 hundred NC. Both the project and the organization were announced at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January 2005. The organization gained its most attention after Nicholas Negroponte (the founding chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s Media Lab) and Kofi Annan unveiled a working prototype of the ‘CM1’ (another laptop model) in November 2005 at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, Tunisia. The whole project is the brain child of Mr. Negroponte.<br /><br />            This novel plan to develop a 100 dollar laptop and distribution to millions of school children of developing countries has caught the interest of governments and attention of many computer industry heavyweights. Some heavyweights supporting this praiseworthy causer are Google, Red Hat, AMD, Brightstar Corporation, News Corporation and Nortel Networks. Each company has donated two million dollars. The MIT Media Lab is also involved in the project.<br /><br />So, what is OLPC then? OLPC is a program to enable all children, everywhere, to have the best education possible. Creating and distributing inexpensive laptops will allow students to become more active and creative, letting them take their learning beyond the walls of their schools and off the pages of textbooks. These $100 laptops will serve as libraries, music studios, art galleries and communications devices, using an open-source software platform that the students can customize and expand as their learning needs and programming skills grow. These machines will permit students to move beyond static, information-centric views of computing and learning by providing a vehicle for experimentation and collaboration. All in all it will teach students how to learn from a wider perspective.<br /><br />Although no contracts with governments have been signed, Mr. Negroponte says current plans call for producing five to ten million units beginning in late 2006 or early 2007, with tens of millions more a year later. As from the map in the official website (http://laptop.org) Nepal lies in yellow category that specifies those countries which are currently seeking government support. Therefore in the context of Nepal we can encourage this project as it will uplift the education status of the whole nation.<br /><br />The Nepali localization of the OLPC project is “Mero Sanu Sathi”. Mero Sanu Sathi is the name given to the laptop that may be distributed to the school children of Nepal. It is not a technical project but an educational project which is of the child not for the child. This is the best way to revitalize and revolutionize our education system that runs at the pace of a tortoise. It does not teach the child but make them learn learning. We haven’t seen any government interest in this topic till date but some NGO’s and INGOs are warming up for this worthy initiative. Interested organizations in Nepal for implementation of this project include FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) Nepal Communtiy, Nepal Engineering College (NEC), UNDP, United Mission to Nepal, Education Network Nepal, Bellanet Asia/SAP International,   Curriculum Development Center,   IT- Resource Nepal (For More see http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Nepal) . But in these sorts of project government help and support is critical. The non government and private organization cannot make this kind of project reality. So I urge government and all concerned parties to support this noble cause.<br /><br />So may be in five to ten years the children going to school in Nepal may be saying “Mummy mero saanu sathi ko battery sakiyo, charge garidinu na hai.”<br /><br />Geshan Manandhar<br />About 650 Words</div>
