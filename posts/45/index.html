  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">What do you think is information in this digital age? From a technical point of view information in the current era is anything that can be <span style="color: #006600; font-weight: bold;">digitized or encoded</span> in a stream of bits can be tagged information. It can be text (words you are reading now), graphics (photos, art forms etc), sound (music, voice etc) or video (animation, movies, music videos etc) or any other mixed form of the above mentioned forms as multimedia. It is a known fact that information has value, some have business value some entertainment value or any other value. It can’t also be denied that consumers differ greatly in how they value particular information good.<br /><br />Information is termed as a <span style="color: #006600; font-weight: bold;">“pure public good”</span>, what does this pure public good connotes? A pure public good is that type of good which is non-rival and non-exclusive (also called non-excludable). Non rival is that quality by which one person’s consumption does not diminish the amount available to other person and non exclusive signifies that one person cannot exclude another person from consuming it. A clichéd example is of the road lamps it is available to all and one person’s consumption doesn’t disturb anyone in anyway. But legal and technical implication may forbid someone from enjoying a likely public good as in TV broadcast.<br /><br />To supplement to public good, information without doubt is <span style="color: #006600; font-weight: bold;">experience good</span>. It must be experienced before we can value it. In this context, every new product is experience good. Example any published article, music, movies etc. So why do copyright and other intellectual property rights counterparts forbid information to be solely bought and commercialized? Can’t the creators and assemblers of the public and experience qualitative information goods sought after alternate ways to keep the public good in the public domain, by which the value of the information will definitely escalate as every commoner will be able to experience, share and amplify the use of that particular information?<br /><br />The answer may lie in use of <span style="color: #006600; font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> (CC</span><span style="color: #006600;">) </span>licenses like share alike, attribution, no commercial use etc. It can’t also be denied that “information is costly and hard to produce but easy and cheap to reproduce.” With the advent of the internet the distribution cost and distribution time has been reduced drastically. The fact that all the cost for producing information is sunk (can’t be recovered if product fails) and demand side economies of scale may also be aspects to opt for strict legal jurisdiction. But it is a tested and proven fact that information has highest value when used by more number of people. So easing off the legal constrictions and leaving the information goods in the public domain will add to its value, as more people will use it and every commoner will benefit from it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Geshan Manandhar</span><br />Around 475 Words<br /><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license"><img alt="Creative Commons License" src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/3.0/88x31.png" style="border-width: 0pt;" /></a><br /><span dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" href="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text" property="dc:title" rel="dc:type">Information is Public good, why Copyright?</span> by <a cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" href="http://www.geshan.blogspot.com/" property="cc:attributionName" rel="cc:attributionURL">Geshan Manandhar</a> is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 Unported License</a>.<br />Based on a work at <a dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" href="http://www.geshan.blogspot.com/" rel="dc:source">www.geshan.blogspot.com</a>.<br />Permissions beyond the scope of this license may be available at <a cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" href="http://www.geshan.blogspot.com/" rel="cc:morePermissions">http://www.geshan.blogspot.com</a></div></div>

Bhansali must have extracted superb performances from the two new comers who belong to big families. The promos are scintillating and inviting the viewers to the theaters from the word go. Let’s see <u>what the new comer Monty has to offer in the music department</u>. The covers are covered with dark blue that is the brand color of the film I guess, all the artists are credited in a comprehensive fashion and the cover depicts <u>Salman and Rani</u> as well, it will be interesting to see them in the movie. The lyrics of most of the songs are penned by Sameer.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The album listening bon-voyage starts with the title track <b style="">“Saawariya” </b>vocalized by assistant music director <u>Sahil Hada</u>. The guitar plucks, innocent voice and the feeling of attachment are the plus in the song. The rhythm is catchy and seems to stick to your mind from the first listen, lyrics are also written effortlessly. Some components remind the old melodies of Kishore Kumar. The user of percussion by the music director is also admirable. Over all the first punch is short, sweet and on the target. Next is <b style="">“Jab Se Tere Naina” </b>crooned by the effervescent <u>Shaan</u>. The lyric is simple and woven remarkably with the free flowing music. The instrumentation is crude but has that soothing feel. Shaan has do a marvelous job and justified the hard efforts of the music director. Subsequently, <u>Kunal Ganjawala and Shreya Ghosal</u> have a song to offer entitled <b style="">“Masha Allah”</b>,<b style=""> </b>the beauty praising lyrics go in sync with the gentle composition. The rhythm remind of the golden era of Indian Music. Exceptionally sung by Ganjawala, his narcotic voice makes you listen to this song over and over again. Two words for this gem of a song Masha Allah. Next number in the album is <b style="">“Thode Badmas” </b>rendered astonishingly by the talented <b style="">Shreya Ghosal</b>. She has maintained perfect harmony with the simple but powerful compositon. Lyrics by Nusrat Badr is fully able to prove the qualities of a man and even Bhansali has proved his compostion skills in this song. Consequently, its time for a new singer <u>Parthiv Gohil</u> to croon <b style="">“Yooon Shabnami”</b>. Still with the slow and stable flow the composer has played with the percussions in this songs in a astounding fashion. The qawalli in the middle adds extra zing to this song. The lyrics is comforting and the singer scores in all bases. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RvvHIxa0F6I/AAAAAAAAAHM/7u5jmQGNn-k/s1600-h/Saawariya_Back_Small.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RvvHIxa0F6I/AAAAAAAAAHM/7u5jmQGNn-k/s320/Saawariya_Back_Small.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5114900755328014242" /></a><br /><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At track 6 we have <b style="">“Daras Bina Nahin Chain” </b>by<b style=""> </b><u>Richa Sharma, Shail Hada and Parthiv Gohil</u>.<b style=""> </b>The<b style=""> </b>background music looms in to this song from the start which give it that raw feel. Again a unadventurous composition, but this one has a dark sense attached to it. The lyric and the classical feel given to the song add to the over all aura of this song. After that <u>Shreya Ghosal</u> lends magical voice to <b style="">“Sawar Gayi”</b>.<b style=""> </b>The<b style=""> </b>lyric by Sameer is just OK in this song but the composition makes the song a hit material. The rhythm is subtle but has the gravity to sweep you off your feet. The unsophisticated orchestration compliments the impeccable word done by the singer. Next on the list is <b style="">“Jaan E Jaan”</b> rendered effortlessly by the soulful voices of <u>Kunal Ganjawala and Shreya Ghosal</u>. Lyric penned down by Sameer is emotional and has that impact. The compostion and arrangement is again mind-blowing and the singers also have put their heart and soul to uplift the song. Consequently <b style="">“Pari”</b> submerged in the addictive voice of <u>Kunal Ganajawal</u> is all set to enchant our ears. The praising in the lyric still continues but this song could be made better with good use of instruments. In this song Ganjawala also has some palaces to improve. Then the legendary singer <u>Alka Yagnik</u> vocalized <b style="">“Chhabeela”</b>.<b style=""> </b>The earthy instrumentation is the USP of this song and here you have a song with that dance feel. Lyrics is just ok, on the contrary Yagnik has done a formidable job. I didn’t expect any remix in this sort of an album but last but not the least there is <b style="">“Saawariya REPRISE”</b> not remix by <u>Sahil Hada</u>. The comoposition is not that different that the first track but the singer proves his vocal skills very well in this fortifying track.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The album has a <b style="">good balance between old and new singers</b> which is good. The length of songs is also encouraging as the title track itself is not even 3 minutes. Though the whole album <u>has that 70’s feel</u> and slow tracks rule the album towards the end you seem to feel bore due to similar compositions and instruments except of the title track. All in all it is a very good album but <b style=""><u>think before buying</u></b>, if you are a remix fan and like 4/4 dance beat numbers this is not the album for you. <u>If you adore old songs and think slow compositions rock then don’t miss this masterpiece</u>.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Around 850 Words</p></div>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">6 years back the musical voyage of Drabyaz band got underway when they were in their eighth standard in Biratnagar. Them they were known as Mirage Guys who were rock performers but with shift of genre to Rock and rap-core they renamed themselves to Drabyaz. Promoting unique music their different is derived from the word Drabya which they say mean “precious jewels”. They want to give ever green songs to the nepali music scenario. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Band is composed of 5 members, Kshitiz Pokhrel in Bass and vocals, Bibin Rijal beating drums and lending his voice for rap core, Sandeep Shrestha in heavy riffs and rhythm. Similarly Aman Dula in lead guitar, mouthorgan and flute, finally Amit Sharma in classical and plugging. The band except Sandeep who joined in later was formed in Biratnagar as the members were of same locality they used to jam together which later tranfromed into a band. Running out from a hostel to record their first song when they were in standard eight was an exciting moment Kshitiz recalls. They are primarily inspired by <st1:placename w:st="on">Linkin</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Park</st1:placetype> and voice that they are the first to do alternative rock and rap-core together in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>. To name inspirations in the local scene they were quick to point Sugam Pokhrel, Sabin Rain and DA 69. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">All being students they say that it’s not easy to practice 2-3 hours a day but they still do that. Concentrating that they have not achieved family support they want to inform that families should support their children who are into music. They also point out that understanding, sacrifice and musical commitment help to sustain a band better. On being asked on rap core they insist that it is a form of rap but it has rock and painful lyrics with rising and falling beats in it which separates it from conventional rap and hip-hop. They divide the work of lyrics writing, composition and arrangement in themselves and claim that all members are involved in all the processes. As it was a new sort of music in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region></st1:place> they had some difficulty in arranging the songs in the beginning but they were helped by Mohit Munal and Araj Keshav for the arrangement.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Their debut album is also named Drabyaz which has 8 songs of which video Bhana Timi is on air and getting popularity in musical shows of different TV channels. Tagging Ma Ramro Chhora as their best track from the album they say all teenagers can relate themselves with this song. Howde keti ko katha and Bibas are some distinct tracks in their album. Their songs are climbing up the charts in a significant manner. They promise to release their album within Dashain and also open up that another video is in the pipeline. On the contrary, they say that Nepali music scenario has a politics of its own; it seems that it invites new artists with open arms but the music companies have their own way of treating the new artists which they don’t support. The power war is clearly evident in Nepali Music companies and even media houses. They emphasize that Music companies should judge the artists on the basis of the music quality not only on their own profit motive. Being a new kind of genre with emphasis on head banging and punk music, on being asked if they promote violence they simply tell it is a mirror image of the current social situation. They add it’s their plea against violence via music. On being questioned about tried and tested formula to generate hits mixing rap and rock together they argue that they have tried something really different and unique in Nepali Music scene. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">They are running high on promoting the album and are busy in concerts in the coming days and weeks. Concerts are scheduled in different parts of <st1:country-region w:st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region> and <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region> in the coming months. They have really worked hard to compile this album and want to thank all the people behind them specially Mohit Munal, Araj Keshav, their friends, Sumit P.J.B Rana, Amrit Sunuar, Manoj and Rajan Maharjan. They well come all kinds of comments, compliments and suggestions about their songs and album on the whole which can be forwarded at <a href="mailto:kshitizp@yahoo.com">kshitizp@yahoo.com</a>. They are even open to any sort of criticism but point out that fans should respect the privacy of the artists. They duly request everyone to listen to their songs and give feedback about their work. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b>Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p></b></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b>Around 800 Words.<o:p></o:p></b></div></div></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Open source is the next big thing for desktops; it is the back bone of the internet and all the servers running widespread around the world. So why do people use FOSS, some advantages include:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The availability of the source code and the right to modify</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right to use the software in any way</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Core software is free</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolving software</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourages hands on</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not tied to a single vendor</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big community to support</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Easy Localization</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better Security</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliability &amp; Stability</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The availability of the source code and the right to modify: is the primary and on of the most important advantage of the open source software. The users can easily change the code to suit their needs. This apprehends the idea that ideas sell rather than only products do. So if you are skilled in any open source tool or language you can modify other’s source code to meet your customer’s needs. </span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right to use the software in any way: In any way may be an overstatement as the licenses govern the use of the software. But still it combined with redistribution rights, ensures (if the software is useful enough), a large population of users, which helps in turn to build up a market for support and customization of the software, which can only attract more and more developers to work in the project. This in turn helps to improve the quality of the product, and to improve its functionality. This, once more, will cause more and more users to give the product a try, and probably to use it regularly.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Core software is free: If you&#8217;re just getting started in online business, cost can be a major factor. Using Open Source software can really cut down on your initial capital outlay. It&#8217;s also a firm belief that the Open Source community has helped to rein in prices on commercial software over the years. You don’t pay for the core software but you might have to lighten your pocket for modifying the software or contracting some company for support and maintenance.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolving software: Some Open Source software projects can have huge communities of programmers involved, allowing for the rapid implementation of new features and security fixes. The communities of users and programmers are also invaluable resources for asking questions relating to troubleshooting and suggesting enhancements. The software like bugzilla, open communities, forums and IRC (Internet Relay Chat) are the tools that the developers and programmers use to continually update the software.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourage hands on: When you&#8217;re short on cash, you are more than likely to want to make modifications to software yourself. Use of Open Source software encourages to go beyond the user interface; to dig into code to try and understand what it does and to make minor edits. As a business owner, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to understand a little of the voodoo that goes on behind the scenes in the software you use on your site. So it does let you have a taste of what a programmer really goes through when programming modules.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not tied to single vendor: If you purchase a commercial application, you can then become reliant on a single company to solve your problems and maintain the software - which can also be very expensive. Some commercial software companies may only provide support and upgrades for a limited time before you need to fork out for any further enhancements or assistance. This clearly shows a high degree of lock in on the customer’s side. As open source software are mainly owned by a community a community is there to support so you are not linked up with a sole vendor if that vendor doesn’t support you are doomed. In case of open source if one person does not support there may be others to do so.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big community to support: Though it may seem that free and open source software is only for programmers but its not the case. There is a big community after free and open source software. It not only about programming but about the open source movement that incorporates people who submit bugs, who test etc who do not need to be core programmers. An example can clarify the growth of community, in case of&nbsp; Drupal (a content management system under GNU GPL license) users, it had around 300 Developing users in Oct -2005 that rose to around 550 developing users in Oct- 2006. The number of Drupal related projects swung from 423 in Oct-2005 to 1173 in Oct-2006.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Easy Localization: Proprietary vendors are motivated by global profit-maximization strategies and hence they do not care about local issues and user needs- unless they matter in a “global context”. FLOSS encourage adapting locally relevant needs, culture in the software. It is also easy to localize open source software as there is availability of code and mechanism to localize the software. Ex: Linux localization was to serve the Nepali Linux users where as Nepali Version of Windows was to capture the market.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better security: As there is a community behind the software not just a software development team, the bugs if they exist are reported rapidly and they are solved as soon as possible. This enables better security system. Any loop hole or but is found out faster as the source is open anyone who sees a bug can report it and can even suggest solutions for the bug making it more secure.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliability and Stability: This also compliments security, a classic example is why switch to Linux from windows, not just because it’s virtually virus free but because of its reliability, stability and configurability. So if the source code is open it will provoke users to read it and find you any bug or code segment with error that will be solved by the original developers or others who can which will result to reliable and stable software that also with legally viable license. </span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">So now its time to jump off the proprietary bandwagon and jump into the &#8220;Free&#8221; world of FOSS.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Aound 1100 Words</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Geshan Manandhar</span></div></div>
