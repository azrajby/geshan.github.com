  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">CodeIgniter is a Model View Controller (MVC) based open source web application framework for use in building dynamic web sites with PHP. It has a very small footprint, built for PHP coders who need a simple and elegant toolkit to create full-featured web applications.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S62OXjAgzSI/AAAAAAAABVY/LTC2FbPK52k/s1600/Ci_home.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S62OXjAgzSI/AAAAAAAABVY/LTC2FbPK52k/s400/Ci_home.png" height="300" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h2>More About CI</h2>Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. For more information see <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com/" target="_blank">Codeigniter</a>&#8217;s official website.<br /><br />As mentioned above the libraries play a great role when you develop your application in Codeigniter. What really helps you ignite your code, if you are a beginner is the amazing <a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/" target="_blank">user guide</a> CodeIgniter can boast about.&nbsp;CodeIgniter is most often noted for its speed when compared to other PHP frameworks, see some&nbsp;comparisons&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sellersrank.com/web-frameworks-benchmarking-results/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br /><h2>The Libraries</h2><div>Working with CodeIgniter for past 2 years (but not writing anything about it ;) ), here are three external libraries that are bound to make your life easier when you choose CodeIgniter to develop your web application:</div><br /><br /><br /><h3>1. EZAuth</h3>Almost all web applications needs an authentication system and there are lots of options for CodeIgniter, among them <a href="http://bizwidgets.biz/ezauth/" target="_blank">EZAuth</a> is a great library to complete the work. The developer defines EZAuth as &#8220;EzAuth is an open source robust PHP/MySQL user database, authorization, access control list and user session management system all bundled into one solution. Before you reinvent the wheel trying to manage users on your website, try out EzAuth. Oh yeah, we built it with CodeIgniter so you’ll need that too.&#8221;<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S62P8LadSeI/AAAAAAAABVg/-kqoKYmUNrw/s1600/CI_ezauth.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S62P8LadSeI/AAAAAAAABVg/-kqoKYmUNrw/s400/CI_ezauth.png" height="252" width="400" /></a></div><br />You can view the <a href="http://bizwidgets.biz/user_guide/ezauth.htm" target="_blank">user guide</a> of EZAuth to know more about it, the current version is 0.6.<br /><br /><h3>2. Ocular</h3>Ocular is by far the best templating library for CodeIgniter, I have used Yet Another Templating System (YATS) but <a href="http://codeigniter.com/wiki/Ocular_Layout_Library/" target="_blank">Ocular</a> is amazing. It is a Rails inspired template library following convention over configuration. &nbsp;It is hosted at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ocular/" target="_blank">Google Code</a> and with&nbsp;features&nbsp;like multiple template, partial views, content Yeild its a great library that will meet almost all your templating needs. With CSS and JS aggregation for production in the new version 1.0, its the best for CI for now.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S62R1oOb1II/AAAAAAAABVo/O2vE4dLqjvU/s1600/CI_ocular.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S62R1oOb1II/AAAAAAAABVo/O2vE4dLqjvU/s400/CI_ocular.png" height="225" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>3. DataMapper</h3>CodeIgniter does not come with any native Object Relation Mapper (ORM) library but I could found out &nbsp;<a href="http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/78305/" target="_blank">IgnitedRecord</a> and <a href="http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/149388/" target="_blank">DataMapper</a> , after using both to some extent I&#8217;d recommend DataMapper. The Over Zealous Edition has some better features than the Datamapper older&nbsp;versions. DataMapper needs the database to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_normal_form" target="_blank">fifth normal form</a>, and there are some other requirements you can see <a href="http://www.overzealous.com/dmz/" target="_blank">here</a>. <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S62TcmKTHkI/AAAAAAAABVw/XKR-iYlSGfM/s1600/CI_Datamapper.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S62TcmKTHkI/AAAAAAAABVw/XKR-iYlSGfM/s400/CI_Datamapper.png" height="267" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />It is designed to map your Database tables into easy to work with objects, fully aware of the relationships between each other. The use of an ORM framework help you a lot, you have an edge over the native Active Record style of coding. Moreover it is more Object oriented with data persistence and as your tables become objects they know the relationships you defined which makes the Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) process easier.<br /><br /><h2>Conclusion</h2>CodeIgniter core has a big list of libraries from form to image manipulation to validation but the above external libraries make it easier to focus more on productivity and creativity and less on the code part of it. You can download and use all the above libraries in your CodeIgniter install, from the relative links.Try out some other fresh libraries by Elliot Haughin, <a href="http://www.haughin.com/2008/02/10/fresh-batch-of-codeigniter-libraries-out-now/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />You can find many libraries for codeIgniter, but above there where the ones I liked when I used it and compared it with similar&nbsp;libraries.<br /><br /><blockquote>Happy Code Igniting and library hunting :).</blockquote></div></div>

At d.o the problem was described as &#8220;If you are using Drupal 6, you must currently install the 6.x-1.x-dev version of Custom Pagers, as there is a serious bug in 6.x-1.10-beta1 (when used with Views, it only shows up to 10 items, no matter what).&#8221; , <a class="ext" href="http://drupal.org/node/371358" target="_blank">here</a><span class="ext"></span> in this node.<br /><h3>Non Obvious Solution</h3>The problem had a non obvious solution we discovered with trial and error.

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
The more I write about Drupal, the more I want to. The more I compliment Drupal, the more I&#8217;d like to. But this blog post is about how to list your Drupal website on some of the (other Drupal) websites to get you more exposure and more traffic equating to more lead and sales.<br /><br />Arguably <a href="http://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a> is the best open source content management system out there, Drupal project usage statistics <a href="http://drupal.org/project/usage/drupal" target="_blank">here</a> show around 40 thousand downloads a day for Drupal core (including 5x, 6x and 7x alpha releases) for last 6 months or so. The 5 websites listed below are basically ideal places to showcase your Drupal site that you have build.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kVctEDHLI/AAAAAAAABUY/LjcM9xAlxoc/s1600-h/drupal_usage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="343" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kVctEDHLI/AAAAAAAABUY/LjcM9xAlxoc/s400/drupal_usage.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br />Among the 40 thousand downloads if only 1% are deployed live daily we will have around 4 hundred new Drupal websites every day and these websites need some publicity, promotion and exposure so below are the (other Drupal) websites that list and showcase Drupal websites.<br /><br /><h3>1. Drupal.org Showcase Forum</h3>Without doubts, you can&#8217;t get more publicity about Drupal anywhere else than Drupal.org. The drupal.org forum &#8220;Showcase&#8221; section <a href="http://drupal.org/forum/25" target="_blank">here</a> gives you a place to list your website and let all other Drupalites see it comment on it and suggest you changes. If you are a member of d.o (which you might be as you are reading this blog post) then you can post about your website/web application or web project built in Drupal <a href="http://drupal.org/node/add/forum/25" target="_blank">here</a>. It is just a forum so you don&#8217;t have the option to post any screenshots but it works fine. If you follow the guidelines given <a href="http://drupal.org/node/281920" target="_blank">here</a>, and land in the Drupal.org homepage then you might get more traffic than you would have expected.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kdLMaJqYI/AAAAAAAABUg/j852OawAtKM/s1600-h/drupal_org_showcase.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="251" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kdLMaJqYI/AAAAAAAABUg/j852OawAtKM/s400/drupal_org_showcase.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>2. www.DrupalSites.net</h3><a href="http://drupalsites.net/" target="_blank">Drupalsites.net</a> can be termed the unofficial Drupal website listing and showcasing website. Its the ultimate Drupal website directory with currently 4043 websites listings. Its also easy you can register, login with Open ID or your Drupal.org username as well. After you login you can add your Drupal website <a href="http://www.drupalsites.net/node/add/weblink" target="_blank">here</a>. It&#8217;s easy and your website is listed instantly just remember to take a screenshot of your website of at least 600x600px to upload to DrupalSites.net.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kdQktkG9I/AAAAAAAABUo/DXkn3ROmv3o/s1600-h/drupalsites_net.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="267" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kdQktkG9I/AAAAAAAABUo/DXkn3ROmv3o/s400/drupalsites_net.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>3. www.Drupalsn.com</h3><a href="http://drupalsn.com/" target="_blank">Drupalsn.com</a> is short for Drupal Social Network a very good website for Drupalites of all types developers, themers, module users etc. The project page of DrupalSN <a href="http://drupalsn.com/projects" target="_blank">here</a> showcases all the projects submitted by website members. After you sign up and login, you can submit your drupal project <a href="http://drupalsn.com/node/add/drupal-project" target="_blank">here</a>. A good thing about DrupalSN as DrupalSites.net is that the project is shown instantly after you submit it without moderation. Showcasing Drupal projects is just one part of DrupalSN, you can post a question or a resource link to the website which can help other fellow Drupal users.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kdU0Bo_zI/AAAAAAAABUw/gByedx6up0w/s1600-h/drupal_sn_project.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kdU0Bo_zI/AAAAAAAABUw/gByedx6up0w/s400/drupal_sn_project.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>4. DrupalMa.com and 5. DrupalMuseum.com</h3>I have put two websites <a href="http://drupalma.com/" target="_blank">DrupalMa.com</a> and <a href="http://drupalmuseum.com/" target="_blank">DrupalMuseum.com</a> here together because the way they funtion are same, both the websites do not allow users to directly submit their website and only showcase &#8220;the best well designed Drupal based websites&#8221; or in other words &#8220;websites that are pleasing to the eye, as well as useful&#8221;. So you can submit your Drupal website to DrupalMa.com <a href="http://www.drupalma.com/showcase/submit" target="_blank">here</a> or DrupalMuseum.com <a href="http://www.drupalmuseum.com/submit-a-drupal-design" target="_blank">here</a> but if your website does not meet the above criteria then your website will not be listed on the showcase. If you think you have a great designed website try submitting to the two sites mentioned above :), best of luck ;).<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kd71G9WZI/AAAAAAAABVA/CgUSV8pW1as/s1600-h/Drupal_Ma_Drupal_Museum.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="237" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kd71G9WZI/AAAAAAAABVA/CgUSV8pW1as/s400/Drupal_Ma_Drupal_Museum.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>Bonus: www.DrupalWebsites.com</h3>Last and may be the least, <a href="http://drupalwebsites.com/" target="_blank">DrupalWebsites.com</a> is a Drupal 5 website that also works in a similar fashion as Drupalsites.net but seems to be a little old now. It also has a <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drupalwebsites" target="_blank">Drupal Module</a> for Drupal 5 to submit websites but I have not used it, so I can&#8217;t really tell how it functions. You can login with Open Id as well and this listing directory website will also need your website&#8217;s screenshot to list your website. This site should really work on its design and upgrade and update.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kdcafT6HI/AAAAAAAABU4/bf3irHTGWDc/s1600-h/drupalwebsites_come.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="286" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5kdcafT6HI/AAAAAAAABU4/bf3irHTGWDc/s400/drupalwebsites_come.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>Conclusion</h3>Listing website in other reputed websites really helps you promote your website, back linking, link sharing can benefit your Search Engine Optimization and your website visit by referring websites.<br /><br /><blockquote>So, after you make your Drupal Website live don&#8217;t forget to add them to the above sites to get more traffic, more lead and more sales :).

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
Recently for a project we were developing, we had a need to show top X bloggers may be top 5 or top 10 bloggers in a block and after some Googling and searching the drupal.org (d.o) site I could not find anything that fit our needs.<br /><br /><h3>The need for a module</h3>Then I decided to write a module that will solve the problem but in a dynamic and flexible way and came up with the idea for Top X Contributors module. If you want to download the module and try it, you can download it <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?myetozzjmko" target="_blank">here</a> or take a look at the code at GitHub.com <a href="http://github.com/geshan/topxcontributors" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br /><h3>What does it do?</h3>The module is very simple, it just shows the top X (X - no. of authors/contributors to show which is configurable) contributors in a HTML list in form of a block for each content type in your Drupal site. Something like below:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5OMdebZD2I/AAAAAAAABUA/_vt1wRgZeQs/s1600-h/Output1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5OMdebZD2I/AAAAAAAABUA/_vt1wRgZeQs/s320/Output1.png" /></a></div><br /><h3>Step to follow</h3>Download the module <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?myetozzjmko" target="_blank">here</a>, and follow the instruction to show the top - &#8220;Content Type&#8221; contributors block where content type is any node type you want be it blog, page or a custom type you created like news or event anything.<br /><br /><h4>Steps</h4><ol><li>Install the module (copy it to your sites/all or sites/all/custom folder)</li><li>Turn on the module from SITEURL/admin/build/modules - or use drush :)</li><li>Then change the settings as per your need: at admin/settings/topxcontributors - as shown below:<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5O3ewrWXiI/AAAAAAAABUI/ykCAh9Zp9Ac/s1600-h/Settings_topx.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5O3ewrWXiI/AAAAAAAABUI/ykCAh9Zp9Ac/s320/Settings_topx.png" /></a></div></li><li>Go to the blocks page SITEURL/admin/build/block/list - and place the newly generated blocks in the block regions you want. (if you want configure the blocks and change the title to whatever you like for example : Top 5 bloggers). <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5O4-Q1vLqI/AAAAAAAABUQ/SfmTjnG73hw/s1600-h/block_placement_topx.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S5O4-Q1vLqI/AAAAAAAABUQ/SfmTjnG73hw/s320/block_placement_topx.png" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;">(Click to Enlarge)</div></li><li>And you are done. See the output as in the first picture above &#8220;Steps to follow&#8221;</li></ol><h3>Improvements</h3>I wanted each node type&#8217;s contributor or author count to be configurable but that above module solved our problem for now so it will not be done for now. If anyone wants to contribute contact me or comment below and help me in GitHub. Any help will be appreciated, I&#8217;ll try for a CVS account at Drupal as well yet again.<br /><h3>Conclusion</h3>I hope the module solves a very small but common problem in Drupal in many community and blogs this might be a very needed and sought after feature but not achieved easily. If views could have done it, it would have been amazing but none the less here is a solution for you all to try out.<br /><br /><blockquote>I have tried to give out what I had developed internally for YIPL hope it helps someone. :) Happy Drupalling. </blockquote></div>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
Hamrolyrics.com is turning 3 today, and YoungInnovations Private Limited (<a href="http://www.yipl.com.np/" target="_blank">YIPL</a>) is also growing at a formidable pace. It all started just 3 years back when we were in college and had plans to do things, make it big and now many things have taken shape. We own our company and its running good. Just to look back I&#8217;m being a little selfish in this blog post and want to be nostalgic on how I started web development, when did it all being and how. Visit <a href="http://hamrolyrics.com/" target="_blank">Hamrolyrics.com</a>.<br /><br /><h3>The Present : Hamrolyrics.com</h3><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S3b3bvjdZpI/AAAAAAAABTw/bofyS9DP6nE/s1600-h/hamrolyrics.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S3b3bvjdZpI/AAAAAAAABTw/bofyS9DP6nE/s400/hamrolyrics.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />It looks good, all thanks to Anjan for his design.<br /><br /><h3>How it all started. </h3>I guess it was early 2000 when I was in my 10th standard, I remember when I told people about email they used to be puzzled. In those times when people didn&#8217;t have an email address I had a website, be it a website in 50megs.com but I had a website then a decade back. I remember internet was a big luxury then, Thamel was the place to be to surf internet and it was amazingly expensive it was Rs. 3 per minute of internet surfing that would cost Rs. 180 per hour which is now around Rs. 20 per hour or so.<br /><br /><h3>Jumping into Web Design not Development yet</h3>So how did I get to the web designing thing, well my cousin Rajeev Manandhar (elder to me) owned a cyber cafe then. I had seen his website and asked him how did you make it, he said I used Frontpage. I was so into computers as I had got a new one some time back and no one around had one. I first saw his site and tired to make something like it. I jotted up a personal site and asked him to upload. I guess he was the one who created my hotmail address that I don&#8217;t use now a days. I&#8217;m into Gmail :).<br /><h3>How the lyrics site started.</h3>After making some websites in plain HTML and some very mad designs with Photoshop, I wanted to do something usable. I wanted to give something that people would like to see, then when I searched for Nepali lyrics in Yahoo or MSN may be then Google was not there or was not that popular in around 2002. I did not find any good site with needed volume of content. Then I decided to build my own and started collecting lyrics. I had typed up more than 500 lyrics in between 2003 start and 2004 end so may be in around 2 years time.<br /><br />I just knew how to design things I had no web programming knowledge and with a dial up connection I could not get any tutorials or anything and yes in that time there we no blogs, no podcasts and no videos. Internet was just about email and surfing static websites like one I was building :).<br /><br />I was so passionate about the website that every week I used to add 10 lyrics and put each entry manually to the alphabets page as per the song and the artist. I even used to record songs from FM as they played the newest tracks I used to record from Naya Pusta (Radio Sagarmatha) as the program played new releases. I had put so much effort on the site but did not expect any return. It was my +2 days and I could use my time like that. I knew some ASP (Active Server Pages) in 2003 mid but did not prefer the new hosting and the new sub domain in brinkster.com. But after I joined my Bachelors I did not pay attention to the website.<br /><br /><h3>Nepalilyrics.150m.com commitment and headaches :)</h3>In Nepalilyrics.150m.com then I started to have bandwidth limit exceeded errors as almost daily the 20 Mb per day allotted bandwidth used to be insufficient. Then I tried to shift the lyrics site to Nepalilyrics.t35.com which had unlimited bandwidth and the two sites ran in parallel. The site now looks very funny I agree but 7 years back it was great when there was no Web 2.0 thing around.<br /><br />Even then I used to get so many feedback like include guitar tabs, you are doing a great job but on one to contribute lyrics or say I&#8217;ll help you. There are lots of feedback now as well : <a href="http://hamrolyrics.com/feedback_view" target="_blank">http://hamrolyrics.com/feedback_view</a>. <br /><br />The major headache after 2 years + of continuous commitment and dedication was now updating lyrics. How much would I update the lyrics from a dial up connection till when, so I stopped it all after a point.<br /><br />I liked to measure the visitors and things form then so I had installed a tracking code in 20th Jan 2003 as the site mentions :). I used addfreestats.com not Google Analytics as I didn&#8217;t know about it 7 years back.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S3b9zAx5cEI/AAAAAAAABT4/Xo2DzxGPWNk/s1600-h/free_stats_neply.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="255" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/S3b9zAx5cEI/AAAAAAAABT4/Xo2DzxGPWNk/s400/free_stats_neply.jpg" width="400" /></a></div><br /><h3>The stats of the visitors to Nepalilyrics.150m.com in the past 7 years.</h3><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/26821710/Nepalilyrics-150m-Stats-Hamrolyrics-com" style="display: block; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-size-adjust: none; font-size: 14px; font-stretch: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 12px auto 6px; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" title="View Nepalilyrics 150m Stats (Hamrolyrics.com) on Scribd">Nepalilyrics 150m Stats (Hamrolyrics.com)</a> <object data="http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf" height="600" id="doc_93733042383361" name="doc_93733042383361" style="outline-color: -moz-use-text-color; outline-style: none; outline-width: medium;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="100%">  <param name="movie" value="http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf"><param name="wmode" value="opaque"><param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><param name="FlashVars" value="document_id=26821710&access_key=key-ypdfsdxfbualyxp0ui0&page=1&viewMode=list"><embed id="doc_93733042383361" name="doc_93733042383361" src="http://d1.scribdassets.com/ScribdViewer.swf?document_id=26821710&access_key=key-ypdfsdxfbualyxp0ui0&page=1&viewMode=list" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="600" width="100%" wmode="opaque" bgcolor="#ffffff"></embed>  </object><br /><br />It shows that 75000 + people have visited the site :). (View in full screen - let&#8217;s not count last 3 years)<br /><br /><h3>Achievements and Learnings</h3><ul><li>The site was featured by Saptahik daily as site of the week on Falgun 16, 2059 BS, see it here (<a href="http://twitpic.com/131dae" target="_blank">http://twitpic.com/131dae</a>).&nbsp;</li><li>I was offered a space at Yokeho.com a very popular portal at that time, I even met a guy at Mercantile ;). (Yokeho.com is dead now)</li><li>I participated in Wave Web winner 2003 I guess my site was more popular than the awards :) but won nothing. 2003.com.np is down now.</li><li>The site was also mentioned in an article in HIMAL khabar partika of 1-15 Baishak 2060, page no 70. (If you can get it from an archive read it)</li><li>Gorkhali.com, nepalisong.net, khattam.com are some of the sites that have offered me spaces for the contents of the site. (It was like being overtaken so I didn&#8217;t accept any of the offers)</li><li>It was site of the month May 2005 in Nepalvista.com (<a href="http://www.nepalvista.com/som05.html" target="_blank">http://www.nepalvista.com/som05.html</a>).</li><li>With hard work it was achieved but I knew from then it would have been profitable as well but the Nepali web audience is lazy and not responsive.</li><li>I guess the only thing that sells in Nepali websphere/ web arena is &#8220;Model Pictures&#8221; - define it yourself, yes there are good blogs and forums but the average Nepali web surfer will never even look at a clean minimalistic design with great content. They will rather jump on a flashy showy &#8220;झिल्के&#8221; website. Sadly thats the only thing that sells here.</li><li>We don&#8217;t believe in community building and I have not seen any community driven Nepali websites, I&#8217;m not talking about social networking or chat websites.</li></ul><br /><h3>Hamrolyics.com - What Next&#8230; </h3>Hamrolyics.com plans to come in a new avatar and with loads of new features. The website is built with Drupal and thank to the genius Bibek Shrestha (<a href="http://twitter.com/bibstha" target="_blank">@bibstha</a>) and his untiring efforts to make Hamrolyrics better. Also many thanks to the whole YIPL team including Anjan, Prashant, Sangita, Rabindra, Sanil and all others for not letting down my dream of having a great Nepali lyrics website, but now we should take a different approach.<br /><br /><h3>Conclusion</h3>We want to handover the website to the community any interested person or group of people are highly encouraged to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@yipl.com.np">info@yipl.com.np</a>. For now you can see the new site beta at <a href="http://new.hamrolyrics.com/" target="_blank">http://new.hamrolyrics.com</a>.<br /><br /><blockquote>I really want people to come forward and take ownership in Hamrolyrics, after all its Hamrolyrics :).</blockquote></div>
