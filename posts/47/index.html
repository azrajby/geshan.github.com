Quoting singing as his habit but he is well versed to sing without any formal training in singing or playing instruments. On the contrary he can and loves to play guitar which he tags as his favorite instrument. He supplements that it’s the base of composition and is lady shaped. He defines music as an integral part of life. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            He was born on November 14 in <st1:place st="on">Kathmandu</st1:place>. Asif completed his schooling from <st1:place st="on"><st1:placename st="on">Everest</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype st="on">School</st1:placetype></st1:place>. He joined <st1:place st="on"><st1:placename st="on">Ashirwad</st1:placename> <st1:placetype st="on">College</st1:placetype></st1:place> to do his +2 in commerce and was admitted to Shanker Dev for BBS but did it from Public Youth. He is fast to tell that the callers on his how identify him as a student of Public Youth. He happily admits that his music career started just by joking but informs that he had to struggle to be the television presenter that he is in current times. He states that singing is a common family hobby and he liked listening to Michael Learns To Rock, Ronan Keating from the West and Shaan and Sonu Nigam from the East growing up as a teenager.  </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            He has tried his hands in works of television producer, video and advertisement director, television presenter, singer and even recently as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">RJ.</span> He explains that a <span style="font-weight: bold;">TV producer</span> is the one who shoots, edits and airs a program so he can be termed the <span style="font-style: italic;">Captain of the ship</span>. He as successfully produces shows like Lifestyle, Music of your choice, SMS and more and others. He has worked for many Nepali TV channels like Channel <st1:country-region st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region> 1, Kantipur and Image Televison. He swiftly denies his interest in National Television.  As a video director this prolific performer has more than 25 videos under his belt among them his personal favorite is “Jindagi Ma” of Nabin K. Bhattarai which got critical acclamation. Some popular videos directed by the gifted individual are Aankha Bhari by Pranil feat. DA 69, Namuna by Mingma Sherpa, Saathi by Sugam Pokhrel, Yehi ho ta maya by Pranil feat. Nabin K. Bhattarai, and the recent talk of the town she is the bomb by the Unity. He has lent his voice to adverts like Himal Steel, Sunsilk, voice over of Vivek Oberai in Dabur’s ad., Ricona, quick chips etc. He has even directed the advertisements of Himal Steel and Sunsilk. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Though labeling his music career as fun but his album <span style="font-weight: bold;">Byakaran of Rap</span> is going to be out till March end this year. The album contains 8 tracks of which the video of Pahilo Maya is a chart topper. The album will be released under the name of Unity of which Asif is an indispensable part. He adds that he has no plans of singing rap but audience will find variety in the album. He clarifies that all songs will be like Pahilo Maya where Asif will sing and the songs will have rap. It has a mix of genres including RnB, Rap, Rock etc. The album’s songs are composed by Asif, Swapnil of Shadows and Sugam Pokhrel has also helped for one song. The whole album’s arrangement credits is to be credited to Rajan Ishan. Asif is quick to say that Nepali music scenario is going well and now is the era of experimental and quality music. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">On being asked about his career he notifies that the balancing act between his careers is spontaneous. It is hectic but hassle free as Unity is a team and the singing he does is a part of the team work that eases his pressure. He doesn’t term his as a singer as only a single is out so he likes to be known as a TV presenter. He denies being <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jack of all and master of none</span> with example that we study commerce with many subjects like Marketing, English, and Mathematics etc but to pass we must get good marks in all of them. So, people tell me that I’m putting my hands in many things but as the study of many subjects I can handle it very well. He updates that he has no big future plans except to work for and promote his album in immediate future. Finally he puts forward his gratitude to all the fans and supporters and says that he would like any kind of comments, suggestion and compliments.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RkPb8xeYaDI/AAAAAAAAACU/PjGbsI6ZHyE/s1600-h/Rajan_Ishan_Studio_Pic_Small.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RkPb8xeYaDI/AAAAAAAAACU/PjGbsI6ZHyE/s320/Rajan_Ishan_Studio_Pic_Small.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5063132243213969458" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt;" /></a>       <br />Rajan Ishan became a household name around a decade back when the ever popular song “Basama Chhian Mero Maan” stormed the nepali charts. Now the multifaceted celebrity is more into arranging then in singing. Defining arranging as a job of a makeup artist where the composition of a song is a bride, he exclaims that arranger is the main person responsible for instrumentation in any song in current context.  </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Born on Asoj 13, 2033 Ishan did his schooling in various schools including Laboratory school, kshitiz school and he completed his schooling in <st1:place st="on"><st1:city st="on">Ranchi</st1:city>, <st1:country-region st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place> in Central Academy Siddhartha Institue. He joined colleges like RR campus,Lalit kala and Shanker Dev campus but didn’t really put his heat and soul in studies. He was more focused into music mainly from 2047 BS. About his music career he informs that he was in sports first, he was a black belt in Karate. Unknowingly he shifted from sports to music.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">He states now he has no time to listen to songs but he used to listen to Mohamad Rafi, Manna de, Kishore Kumar and Mehendi Hasan. He was also a fan of Scorpians, Michael learns to rock and Brian Adams in the yesteryears. Amongst the various instruments he knows to play like mouthorgan, bansure (murali), guitar, drum, madal, keyboard, dholak and harmonium he likes the guitar most. He says it was the first instrument he learned and he is attached to it more. Ishan had formal trainings for guitar and basic classical course from Nhyoo Bajracharya in Doremi. He has also done Jr. Diploma in Eastern classical music.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Struggle has not been a part and parcel of life for Rajan but he has got his share of working experience required to be a successful arranger he is now. He was an assistant in Alpha Digital Studio where he learnt the recording related tasks. He worked as a recordist in Opus studio and Royaltone studio. He had opened his own studio called Naad but now he has his home studio named Virtual Studio at Sucheka Galli, Ason. He emphasized that work should be done sincerely. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Rajan Ishan as a singer has released two solo albums Rohini vol. 1 (2054 BS) and Ishan (2059 BS). He has also brought out an album as a member of the band Nishad called Nishad (2055 BS) itself. As an arranger he has bagged fifty songs under his belt. Some of the popular numbers he has arranged are “Basama Chhaina”, “Chham Chham”, Namuna, “Priyatama”, “Pahilo maya” and “Kahile aago” and “Maan ko rani” in recent times. Rajan likes to have a versatile approach on arrangement of songs and wants to be variety oriented. He thanks god for making him able to arrange such diverse songs from pop to RnB. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">He achieved the best new artist award in Hits FM Music awards 2056. The well admired video of “Basa Ma Chhaina” got the award of best video in SanMiguel Awards in 2056 bagged by Alok Nembang. He has also done jingles for advertisements including the recent advertisement of Quick Chips which features “Basa Ma Chhiana”. He is doing advert jingles for Hama Steel and Ricona as well. There by he has got his hands involved in many fields. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Though he is not in the limelight, he is ahead to say that he is not media shy. He likes to be known as a good compose and arranger. He wants himself to be called as a music director who is a complete package in his own rights. In the pipeline we have Mausami Gurung’s new album, Yash Kumar’s album, Unity’s Next album called Byakaran, Sugam Pokhrel’s next album called Paathshala and Aau mero saath by Satish Shrestha which are all arranged by Rajan. The list of songs will soon reach the century mark when he arranges songs for<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Agantuk Kharel of which Ban Ma Fulyo Phool is rocking the charts now a days</span>, his own next album, Dhiraj Rai and Satya Swarup Shrestha. In the year 2064 he aims that in the top ten song of the year the top five will be arranged by him. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">This down to earth humble human being has changed with time. A decade back he arranged slow song like “Basama chhaina” and how he has arranged hit numbers like Maan ko rani and Pahilo Maya. He claims that now the era is of RnB, hip hop with 4/4 beats so songs should be short in lengthy and catchy from the word go.  He also adds that this is the golden period in Nepali music and presence on many Medias has helped uplift Nepali music to this level. He is happy that just by arranging in our country also a person can survive easily. This believer in god stresses on positive thinking and healthy living.

Slated to release with a month, the promos aired late if I have to opine. Well the flick seems a race car father’s story with more than enough dose of emotions as the usual Yash Raj film. Back to the cover, the use of balanced colors is impressive, even the cover portrays the hard work done by the stylist and the costume designers so all you style junkies have a teaser what’s in store in the movie just by analyzing the pictures in the in lay. The cover is amply informative with credits to all the people involved behind the album mainly the professionals at the YRF studios. The lyrics of this album are penned down by the exuberant and experienced Javed Akhtar.   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>This is I guess the second time Vishal-Shekhar’s vibrant duo has given music for a Yash Raj venture. So, I can’t stop comparing it with Salaam Namaste. It had just 4 songs and 2 remixes but this album as 6 songs and no remixes or other versions of the same song. Lets put this album under the music scanner, the album starts off with the title track <b style="">“Ta Ra Rum Pum” </b>, Saif starts with “Ok now listen up, we are going to tell you a story, a story of 4 guys Ta Ra Ma and Pa”, you can easily guess who is who. The singers <u>Shaan, Mahalaxmi, Sneha and Shravan</u> have vocalized the songs in a formidable manner. I assume Sneha and Shravan Suresh provide the voices for the kids. The lyric is childish but fun to listen to. Percussions stand out in the song, rhythm is catchy and unlike regular movie titles it’s a short track of just 4 minutes. Next is <b style="">“Hey Shona” </b>, it is duet sung by the successful jodi of <u>Shaan and Sunidhi Chauhan</u>. I don’t know where will they place this romantic number but the instrumentation is awesome. The lyrics are heart-felt and the composition runs thru your heart from the word go. Consequently, a dance track is all set to rock you entitled <b style="">“Nachle Ve”</b>. The rhythm is gripping as the regular Vishal Sherkhar dance tracks; the use of authentic instruments like the dhol has enchanced the song. The mix of synthetic sounds with conventional instruments is astonishing. Lyric is just good enough but the singers <u>Sonu Nigam and Somya Raoh</u> have executed the song in a remarkable fashion. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>At track 4 we have “<b style="">Ta Ra Ra Ra Rum Tararumpum” </b>which<b style=""> </b>has<b style=""> </b>very hopeful lyrics and points that hope never dies. Prolific singer <u>Shreya Ghosal</u> has done full justice to the composition but this song seems a version 2 of the title track. This track is tragic but supportive on the whole. Subsequently “<b style="">Ab to forever</b>” comes next on the list, this number kicks of with <u>KK</u> uttering the lyrics which is amazingly supported by <u>Shreya Ghoshal & Vishal Dadlani</u>. The hinglish lyrics by the wordsmith Akhtar is not up to the mark but the composition is in vogue. The proper mix of the typical melodies with the synthetic sound will make it the next chart buster as well as a club rocker. Last but not the least we come across <b style="">“Saaiyaan” </b>which is tenaciously sung by <u>Vishal Dadlani</u>. I speculate if he is one half of the music director duo of this movie. The theme of the title runs thru this song and the guitars are done expressively by Ehsaan Noorani who is rightly credited in the in lay. Lyrics seem somewhere heard before but the signature Vishal-Shekhar fragrance can be sniffed in this track. The composition is earthy and relevant.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>On the whole, the theme’s piece runs through almost all the tracks but amazingly two trends are broken. One bad hinglish lyrics by the maestro and two short tracks by the dynamic duo Vishal-Shekhar. All in all, the movie looks different and the music supports to the themes there by this album can be included in your top 25 great albums.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Around 700 Words</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Also Available at</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"> http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Ta_Ra_Rum_Pum_Album-123050-1.html<br /></p></div>

This seems to an over statement in current milieu but it may not be distant dream. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) association is a <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region></st1:place> based non-profit organization set up to oversee “The Children&#8217;s Machine” project and the construction of the 2B1 (laptop model) &#8220;$100 laptop&#8221; converts to around 7 thousand 5 hundred NC. Both the project and the organization were announced at the World Economic Forum in <st1:place st="on"><st1:city st="on">Davos</st1:city>, <st1:country-region st="on">Switzerland</st1:country-region></st1:place> in January 2005. The organization gained its most attention after Nicholas Negroponte (the founding chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#8217;s Media Lab) and Kofi Annan unveiled a working prototype of the ‘CM1’ (another laptop model) in November 2005 at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, Tunisia. The whole project is the brain child of Mr. Negroponte.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><span style="">   </span>This novel plan to develop a 100 dollar laptop and distribution to millions of school children of developing countries has caught the interest of governments and attention of many computer industry heavyweights. Some heavyweights supporting this praiseworthy causer are Google, Red Hat, AMD, Brightstar Corporation, News Corporation and Nortel Networks. Each company has donated two million dollars. The MIT Media Lab is also involved in the project.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>So, what is OLPC then? OLPC is a program to enable all children, everywhere, to have the best education possible. Creating and distributing inexpensive laptops will allow students to become more active and creative, letting them take their learning beyond the walls of their schools and off the pages of textbooks. These $100 laptops will serve as libraries, music studios, art galleries and communications devices, using an open-source software platform that the students can customize and expand as their learning needs and programming skills grow. These machines will permit students to move beyond static, information-centric views of computing and learning by providing a vehicle for experimentation and collaboration. All in all it will teach students how to learn from a wider perspective.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>Although no contracts with governments have been signed, Mr. Negroponte says current plans call for producing five to ten million units beginning in late 2006 or early 2007, with tens of millions more a year later. As from the map in the official website (http://laptop.org) <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region> lies in yellow category that specifies those countries which are currently seeking government support. Therefore in the context of <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region> we can encourage this project as it will uplift the education status of the whole nation. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>The Nepali localization of the OLPC project is “Mero Sanu Sathi”. Mero Sanu Sathi is the name given to the laptop that may be distributed to the school children of <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It is not a technical project but an educational project which is of the child not for the child. This is the best way to revitalize and revolutionize our education system that runs at the pace of a tortoise. It does not teach the child but make them learn learning. We haven’t seen any government interest in this topic till date but some NGO’s and INGOs are warming up for this worthy initiative. Interested organizations in Nepal for implementation of this project include FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) Nepal Communtiy, Nepal Engineering College (NEC), UNDP, United Mission to Nepal, Education Network Nepal, Bellanet Asia/SAP International,<span style="">   </span>Curriculum Development Center,<span style="">   </span>IT- Resource Nepal (For More see http://wiki.laptop.org/go/OLPC_Nepal) . But in these sorts of project government help and support is critical. The non government and private organization cannot make this kind of project reality. So I urge government and all concerned parties to support this noble cause.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>So may be in five to ten years the children going to school in <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region></st1:place> may be saying “Mummy mero saanu sathi ko battery sakiyo, charge garidinu na hai.”</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">    </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p><br />About 650 Words<o:p></o:p></span></p></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RhCzLH5Rk-I/AAAAAAAAAB0/y8-LEuTDg_w/s1600-h/Geshan_N_Goher_Jal_Interview_EV_Small.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RhCzLH5Rk-I/AAAAAAAAAB0/y8-LEuTDg_w/s320/Geshan_N_Goher_Jal_Interview_EV_Small.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5048732185961534434" style="cursor: pointer; float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px;" /></a><br /><o:p></o:p>       It was 18<sup>th</sup> December 2006, I had got a call last night on 17<sup>th</sup> December 2006 that I may have to take Jal’s interview from my friend who works for In your face magazine. I had contributed an article for that mag in the past. I work till 1 AM to jot down the questions to ask the ever popular young and energetic band whose life performance I witnessed just two days back on 16<sup>th</sup> December 2006. I am a fan of jal for that matter.     <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            The day arrives, in the morning I’m informed to reach the parking of Hyatt at 10. I reach there on time, thing to consider is that I have an exam (viva) to give at 11:30 or 12:00. There seems to a miscommunication but we are informed that Jal has gone for a mountain flight. To no avail, we wait for an hour or so. Then the Jal’s manager inform us they are coming. He meant that they are coming down from their room but we scanned every incoming vehicle to sum up the work. Then Jal’s manager was behaving so good with us.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            After around two hours of endless waiting, the terrific trio of Jal finally arrive at the lobby of Hyatt. I run to the lead vocalist Salman Butt and ask him to give me few minutes. Goher is a litter far and Shazi is in his own world. Just as I begin to ask the first question the chameleon nature of the manager shows, he is so eager to move. Informs me that they are getting late. He had ensured that he will provide 10 minutes or so but I had to sum up the interview in just 1:45 mins with just two questions asked. I was so unsatisfied as my hard work was unjustified and I still had a exam to give. Another point to notice is that Mr. Butt didn’t feel the need to stop smoking while answering my question. Do you call this Jal (Manger mainly)’s disrespect to media or what? I really wished that they missed their flight!!!! A ray of hope they had the decency to wave us bye.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            The next day I get the anchor story of THT(The Himalayan Times) that ‘Jal’s manager is held with illegal notes’ I was so happy. Let’s put it aside but I’m a big fan of Jal. The way they treated a media person was reprehensible. If they had told they won’t give the interview we could have returned, they didn’t value our time. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            Nonetheless, today 27<sup>th</sup> December 2006 I again get a call when I’m returning home from college. I just find out that I have to interview the creative genius behind Jal – Goher Mumtaz only as others have returned and Manager is still in custody. I was per-informed about this so I had prepared the questions; I jump home print the question and head for the interview at 6. Reach a hotel at Jwalakhel and landed in Goher Mumtaz’s room. He was watching cricket at that time. This man is truly talented no doubts about that as he is the lyricist, lead and rhythm guitarist and above all composes the songs for Jal. Buts still on the contrary to my bitter experience 9 days back he is down to earth and humble. Primarily, the interview as very good, I have recorded it. He did smoke but had the decorum to blow the smoke away from me. A fine-looking tall gifted artist being perplexed by my question was what I enjoyed the most in today’s interview. All in all I must add you must set aside the emotion and feelings in professional life to a level, or it forbids you from giving your best shot. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">         <br />          This was the bitter and sweet experience I had with interviewing Jal. Hope it was likable. If I get the photos I’ll add them up.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p><br />Geshan Manandhar</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Around 650 Words</div></div></div>
