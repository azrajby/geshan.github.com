  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Open source is the next big thing for desktops; it is the back bone of the internet and all the servers running widespread around the world. So why do people use FOSS, some advantages include:</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The availability of the source code and the right to modify</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right to use the software in any way</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Core software is free</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolving software</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourages hands on</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not tied to a single vendor</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big community to support</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Easy Localization</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better Security</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliability &amp; Stability</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The availability of the source code and the right to modify: is the primary and on of the most important advantage of the open source software. The users can easily change the code to suit their needs. This apprehends the idea that ideas sell rather than only products do. So if you are skilled in any open source tool or language you can modify other’s source code to meet your customer’s needs. </span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The right to use the software in any way: In any way may be an overstatement as the licenses govern the use of the software. But still it combined with redistribution rights, ensures (if the software is useful enough), a large population of users, which helps in turn to build up a market for support and customization of the software, which can only attract more and more developers to work in the project. This in turn helps to improve the quality of the product, and to improve its functionality. This, once more, will cause more and more users to give the product a try, and probably to use it regularly.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Core software is free: If you&#8217;re just getting started in online business, cost can be a major factor. Using Open Source software can really cut down on your initial capital outlay. It&#8217;s also a firm belief that the Open Source community has helped to rein in prices on commercial software over the years. You don’t pay for the core software but you might have to lighten your pocket for modifying the software or contracting some company for support and maintenance.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evolving software: Some Open Source software projects can have huge communities of programmers involved, allowing for the rapid implementation of new features and security fixes. The communities of users and programmers are also invaluable resources for asking questions relating to troubleshooting and suggesting enhancements. The software like bugzilla, open communities, forums and IRC (Internet Relay Chat) are the tools that the developers and programmers use to continually update the software.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourage hands on: When you&#8217;re short on cash, you are more than likely to want to make modifications to software yourself. Use of Open Source software encourages to go beyond the user interface; to dig into code to try and understand what it does and to make minor edits. As a business owner, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to understand a little of the voodoo that goes on behind the scenes in the software you use on your site. So it does let you have a taste of what a programmer really goes through when programming modules.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not tied to single vendor: If you purchase a commercial application, you can then become reliant on a single company to solve your problems and maintain the software - which can also be very expensive. Some commercial software companies may only provide support and upgrades for a limited time before you need to fork out for any further enhancements or assistance. This clearly shows a high degree of lock in on the customer’s side. As open source software are mainly owned by a community a community is there to support so you are not linked up with a sole vendor if that vendor doesn’t support you are doomed. In case of open source if one person does not support there may be others to do so.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Big community to support: Though it may seem that free and open source software is only for programmers but its not the case. There is a big community after free and open source software. It not only about programming but about the open source movement that incorporates people who submit bugs, who test etc who do not need to be core programmers. An example can clarify the growth of community, in case of&nbsp; Drupal (a content management system under GNU GPL license) users, it had around 300 Developing users in Oct -2005 that rose to around 550 developing users in Oct- 2006. The number of Drupal related projects swung from 423 in Oct-2005 to 1173 in Oct-2006.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Easy Localization: Proprietary vendors are motivated by global profit-maximization strategies and hence they do not care about local issues and user needs- unless they matter in a “global context”. FLOSS encourage adapting locally relevant needs, culture in the software. It is also easy to localize open source software as there is availability of code and mechanism to localize the software. Ex: Linux localization was to serve the Nepali Linux users where as Nepali Version of Windows was to capture the market.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Better security: As there is a community behind the software not just a software development team, the bugs if they exist are reported rapidly and they are solved as soon as possible. This enables better security system. Any loop hole or but is found out faster as the source is open anyone who sees a bug can report it and can even suggest solutions for the bug making it more secure.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">10.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliability and Stability: This also compliments security, a classic example is why switch to Linux from windows, not just because it’s virtually virus free but because of its reliability, stability and configurability. So if the source code is open it will provoke users to read it and find you any bug or code segment with error that will be solved by the original developers or others who can which will result to reliable and stable software that also with legally viable license. </span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">So now its time to jump off the proprietary bandwagon and jump into the &#8220;Free&#8221; world of FOSS.</span><br /><br style="font-family: Verdana;" /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Aound 1100 Words</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Geshan Manandhar</span></div></div>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/Rsz6w513VjI/AAAAAAAAAEg/5fTbJY6QpUA/s1600-h/ms.gif" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/Rsz6w513VjI/AAAAAAAAAEg/5fTbJY6QpUA/s320/ms.gif" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5101728195971339826" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;" /></a><br /><br />Lock in is a term that denotes where a customer is dependent on a vendor for products and services and cannot move to another vendor without substantial switching costs, real and/or perceived. Lock in is exercised in any and every kind of product for better profits by extending the lock-in cycle by trapping the customer in a deep net of expenses the are not evidently clear in the first transaction. So, the computer and software market is also not free from the lock-in phenomena. The question here is lock-in can be the survival kit for the sellers but to what extent can they exploit the buyers?<br /><br />Microsoft the software giant as everyone knows it as, is undoubtedly one of the best practitioners of lock-in to grip its customers. Its software carries a high level of vendor lock-in, based on its extensive set of proprietary Application Programming Interface (API). Their degree of lock-in combined with their market share has made them subject to a number of antitrust lawsuits. Without making it technical, if you are using a windows operating system, you further use Microsoft’s Office in addition to it you tend to use the Microsoft’s mail client. If you are a web developer they even provide MS Frontpage, you have visual basic for programming and the recent dot net also has been incorporated in Microsoft’s products. There by, if you get fully dependent on Microsoft and say as they are fully proprietary and without doubts profit oriented, they try to charge even for running their application then one will have no place to hide!<br />Another fact to consider is, Microsoft&#8217;s application software also exhibits lock-in through the use of proprietary file formats. Microsoft Word and Microsoft Outlook both, for example, use proprietary datastore files and interfaces which are impossible to read without being parsed, and such parsers may in turn not be able to exist legally without performing reverse engineering. For example, to access data contained in Outlook&#8217;s &#8216;.PST&#8217; files, the application must process the request through Outlook instead of directly handling the file. Present versions of Microsoft Word have introduced a new more open format MS-OOXML. This may make it easier for competitors to write documents compatible with Microsoft Office in the future by reducing lock-in, but as a competitor to the OpenDocument format, it may instead increase lock-in through an Embrace, extend and extinguish effect. Thus, how can we ensure that Microsoft will not charge us one day even for opening their file format. As only they know how to open the files we may be in a risk of paying them just to view our files we ourselves made.<br />All in all, I’m not trying to prove Microsoft bad but we should ourselves be aware of the hard possibilities in future. It may be their way to carry on their business but we should also be aware of the alternative ways rather than getting firmly locked in with a sole vendor. The intellectual property rights will make sure that we have to pay what the giant asks for in the future, therefore act now to be safe later.<br />Geshan Manandhar<br />Around 525 Words</div></div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RsUXjZ13ViI/AAAAAAAAADo/6thcnUSBGTQ/s1600-h/Heyy_Babyy_Cover_Small.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RsUXjZ13ViI/AAAAAAAAADo/6thcnUSBGTQ/s320/Heyy_Babyy_Cover_Small.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5099508050066626082" border="0" /></a>       <o:p></o:p>Feasting the eyes with a <u>multitude of stars</u> in the first promo of the title track was all set to grab attention of any and every bollywood fan. The song provided a dance vibe from the word go plus it was set in a club setting. The compilation is <u>Heyy Babyy why two ys in both words I think Sajid Khan the VJ turned director knows</u>. About the album, the cover is scintillating with the four lead actors but Vidya Balan is looking as pretty as ever. The lyrics given in the inlays is a good example set, the pictures in the inside are also glittery. Shanker Ehsan Loy (SEL) this time also <u>have given the old formula of mixing fast paced songs and slow soothing numbers</u> in the same album.   </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>The album kicks off with the title track <b style="">“Heyy Babyy” </b>stylishly vocalized by <u>Niraj Shridhar, Raman, Prevez Quadir and Loy</u>. This is a full on dance track with techno beats and sultry lyrics to accompany the overall feel of the movie of the three out of control guys. Next is “<b style="">Dholna</b>” magnificently crooned by the deadly duo of <u>Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghosal</u>. Its great to hear Sonu after a long time and Shreya was also out of lime light after Leja Leja. The song has earthy instrumentation and that first love feel written all over it. Sameer has penned down <b style="">commendable lyrics</b> for this song and for the whole album except of the variation of the title track by Girl Band. After that soothing track, we come across <b style="">“Mast Kalandar”</b> which is sung by <u>Salim Shehzada, Rehan Khan, Shankar Mahadevan and<span style="">  </span>Sajid Khan</u>. The instrument selection is unsophisticated and gives you the wedding song feel from the first Shenai hear. Singers have done full justice with the compilation and the lyric goes in sync with the melody. This song provokes you to put on your dance shoes. Subsequenly, “<b style="">Heyy Babyy</b>” vocalized by <u>Girl band featuring DJ Akbar Sami</u><b style=""> </b>enchants our ears. Girl Band comprises of <u>Renee Armstrong, Patrice Tipaki, Renee Bargh & Jessica Smith</u>. Pakistani singers have had been featured in bollywood movie albums but now its time for the singers from the west. It is a typical Akbar Sami dance track with high tempo and addictive 4/4 beats. The English lyric is provided by Anvita Dutt Guptan and Girl Band. Consequently <b style="">“Jane Bhi De” </b>reaches our ears which is sung by <u>Shankar Mahadevan and Loy Mendosa,</u> I can’t figure our why they missed Ehasan. Well the duo from the terrific trio has done a fine job of singing their own composition. The song has the apologetic lyric and the rhythm is one you start humming from the first listen. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>At track 6 we have <b style="">“Meri Duniya Tu Hi Re” </b>which is crooned by three shining S of the bollywood music scenario <u>Sonu, Shaan and Shankar</u>. This is by far the best slow song in the album, I think its shot on the baby and her three fathers. The song has amazing lyric with the slow pace that builds up as the song passes by. Then there are three remixes, first remix is “<b style="">Dholna Remix</b>” by <b style="">DJ WhoSane. </b>It<b style=""> </b>is<b style=""> </b>a slow mix of the orginal song without the dance type heavy beats but the DJ has done enough to keep the soul of the song intact. The English rap adds the needed zing to this remix but Sonu’s voice stands out even in the RnB type music. After that we have <b style="">“Heyy Babyy Big O Mix” </b>which is also re-arranged by <b style="">DJ WhoSane. </b>This<b style=""> </b>remix unlike the above one is fast paced and can be called a dance mix with amplifying the heat of the original. The out of the box experiments in sound should have been avoided it will stop the song from being a big club hit. Last but not the least is <b style="">“Jane Bhi De Hiccup Remix” </b>by <b style="">DJ WhoSane </b>which is a proper Rap Mix of the original. With the increased tempo, good beat-matching and extra voices being mixed up this song can become a disco burner in near future.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>All in all, this album is a good one from the trio who has given big hits. It is not as good as the other compilations they have put their hands in but ok for collecting one SEL album. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p></b></p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">Around 750 Words</p></div>
