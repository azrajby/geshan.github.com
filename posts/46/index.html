The song provided a dance vibe from the word go plus it was set in a club setting. The compilation is <u>Heyy Babyy why two ys in both words I think Sajid Khan the VJ turned director knows</u>. About the album, the cover is scintillating with the four lead actors but Vidya Balan is looking as pretty as ever. The lyrics given in the inlays is a good example set, the pictures in the inside are also glittery. Shanker Ehsan Loy (SEL) this time also <u>have given the old formula of mixing fast paced songs and slow soothing numbers</u> in the same album.   </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>The album kicks off with the title track <b style="">“Heyy Babyy” </b>stylishly vocalized by <u>Niraj Shridhar, Raman, Prevez Quadir and Loy</u>. This is a full on dance track with techno beats and sultry lyrics to accompany the overall feel of the movie of the three out of control guys. Next is “<b style="">Dholna</b>” magnificently crooned by the deadly duo of <u>Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghosal</u>. Its great to hear Sonu after a long time and Shreya was also out of lime light after Leja Leja. The song has earthy instrumentation and that first love feel written all over it. Sameer has penned down <b style="">commendable lyrics</b> for this song and for the whole album except of the variation of the title track by Girl Band. After that soothing track, we come across <b style="">“Mast Kalandar”</b> which is sung by <u>Salim Shehzada, Rehan Khan, Shankar Mahadevan and<span style="">  </span>Sajid Khan</u>. The instrument selection is unsophisticated and gives you the wedding song feel from the first Shenai hear. Singers have done full justice with the compilation and the lyric goes in sync with the melody. This song provokes you to put on your dance shoes. Subsequenly, “<b style="">Heyy Babyy</b>” vocalized by <u>Girl band featuring DJ Akbar Sami</u><b style=""> </b>enchants our ears. Girl Band comprises of <u>Renee Armstrong, Patrice Tipaki, Renee Bargh & Jessica Smith</u>. Pakistani singers have had been featured in bollywood movie albums but now its time for the singers from the west. It is a typical Akbar Sami dance track with high tempo and addictive 4/4 beats. The English lyric is provided by Anvita Dutt Guptan and Girl Band. Consequently <b style="">“Jane Bhi De” </b>reaches our ears which is sung by <u>Shankar Mahadevan and Loy Mendosa,</u> I can’t figure our why they missed Ehasan. Well the duo from the terrific trio has done a fine job of singing their own composition. The song has the apologetic lyric and the rhythm is one you start humming from the first listen. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>At track 6 we have <b style="">“Meri Duniya Tu Hi Re” </b>which is crooned by three shining S of the bollywood music scenario <u>Sonu, Shaan and Shankar</u>. This is by far the best slow song in the album, I think its shot on the baby and her three fathers. The song has amazing lyric with the slow pace that builds up as the song passes by. Then there are three remixes, first remix is “<b style="">Dholna Remix</b>” by <b style="">DJ WhoSane. </b>It<b style=""> </b>is<b style=""> </b>a slow mix of the orginal song without the dance type heavy beats but the DJ has done enough to keep the soul of the song intact. The English rap adds the needed zing to this remix but Sonu’s voice stands out even in the RnB type music. After that we have <b style="">“Heyy Babyy Big O Mix” </b>which is also re-arranged by <b style="">DJ WhoSane. </b>This<b style=""> </b>remix unlike the above one is fast paced and can be called a dance mix with amplifying the heat of the original. The out of the box experiments in sound should have been avoided it will stop the song from being a big club hit. Last but not the least is <b style="">“Jane Bhi De Hiccup Remix” </b>by <b style="">DJ WhoSane </b>which is a proper Rap Mix of the original. With the increased tempo, good beat-matching and extra voices being mixed up this song can become a disco burner in near future.</p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>All in all, this album is a good one from the trio who has given big hits. It is not as good as the other compilations they have put their hands in but ok for collecting one SEL album. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><b style="">Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p></b></p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">Around 750 Words</p></div>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Common is defined as shared by or coming from more than one or belonging to whole community by the oxford dictionary. In the current context commons is a concept that underlines the idea of any common resource that is available to all but can be locally defined or specifically as &#8220;everybody belongs to category x&#8221;. Commons is an age old tradition mainly practiced in the East/south. Like the common village land, common water source etc. Similarly, commons is of two types primarily they are physical resource and human made resource. Human made resource can incorporate a body of information which is part of a culture and intellectual heritage.<br /><br />Commons is almost synonymous to public domain. So what is public domain then, public domain comprises of body of knowledge and innovation in relation to which no person or other legal entity can establish or maintain proprietary interests within a particular legal jurisdiction. The good and the bad side of public domain resource is, in general anyone may use or exploit the resource whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes. In general understanding, an item of work is not is public domain it may be result of a proprietary interest such as copyright, patent or other rights. So a resource in a public domain is very important to the commoner who is interested to use the resource in any form. The figure below attempts to explain the commons in a better way.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SAS8Gm4NqzI/AAAAAAAAAVo/gWktQ7yW5eI/s1600-h/Commons_Resource_Pool.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SAS8Gm4NqzI/AAAAAAAAAVo/gWktQ7yW5eI/s400/Commons_Resource_Pool.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5189479492339215154" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center;" /></a><br />Commons or common resource is beneficial to the commoners. But on the negative side if the common resource has probability to be depleted mainly on following grounds:</div><ol style="text-align: justify;"><br /><li> Privatization of resource (Mainly via use of intellectual property rights IPR)</li><br /><li> Over Consumption</li><br /><li> No way to replenish the commons</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Lets take a simple example, water is supposed to be a common resource so why do we pay for water to the government. Can we say that there won’t be a day when the government won’t charge us for clean air in this case of over pollution? Let’s hope that day does not come.<br /><br />Let’s analyze how intellectual property rights like copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret help growth reduction. The validity of a copyright for a book is life of author plus 70 years in current context. So after lets say about 140 years the resource comes back to the public domain. But core businessmen are trying to make the validity infinity minus 1 day which is bound to create problems. For further information please see www.copyright.gov on how copyright is certain to create troubles.<br /><br /><br />On a technical base let’s try to define digital commons. Digital commons are those intellectual properties specifically in digital form and in the public domain. Digital commons tries to define in concrete terms that everyone is able to enjoy the digital revolution.  It mainly advocates about the free and open source software, open source software and creative commons. The figure below tries to clarify the commons concept with copyright and copyleft.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SAS8Y24Nq0I/AAAAAAAAAVw/MTuF0aMJcY0/s1600-h/Copyleft_Copyright_Spectrum.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SAS8Y24Nq0I/AAAAAAAAAVw/MTuF0aMJcY0/s400/Copyleft_Copyright_Spectrum.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5189479805871827778" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center;" /></a><br />An amazing fact about copyright © is that we don’t even have to mention copyright © Name and year to mark that we have the copyright of the creation or resource it is implicit by law. So if nothing is mentioned then it means copyright automatically. It is the restriction to copy or use the resource in any form. But commons is a transparent concept there by in the software world people like Richard Stallman and others advocated the concept of free software, free not as in cost but the freedom to use and modify. Free software is a software which is in the public domain for eternity. The free software foundation germinated licenses like GNU GPL (GNU Not Unix General Public License) and GNU FDL (GNU Not Unix Free Document License) that made it possible to use the software, distribute or redistribute it and make modifications to the existing software and as per condition sell it as well.<br /><br />Other that the GNU licenses there is another license called Creative Commons (CC) it mainly talks of following things, which are</div><ol style="text-align: justify;"><br /><li> Attribution : Attribute the original author of the content</li><br /><li>Derivative : Allow derivative work of the resource</li><br /><li>Commercial : Allow or not allow commercial use of the resource</li><br /><li>Share Alike: The resource can be modified but should be given back in the same license it is take from the commons.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />There by rather than going towards the conventional copyright we must break the barrier by collaborative work that gives rise to the age old and proven concept of commons.<br /><br />Geshan Manandhar<br />Around 850 Words</div></div></div>

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RpXASnaM_bI/AAAAAAAAADc/eB_YUsPWnuA/s1600-h/Cash_Cover_Small_GM.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RpXASnaM_bI/AAAAAAAAADc/eB_YUsPWnuA/s320/Cash_Cover_Small_GM.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5086182780233907634" border="0" /></a><o:p></o:p><span style="">            </span>When I first listened to and watched the promo of the title songs of Cash I was <u>instantly reminded of title track of DUS</u>. No marks for guessing that it was a typical Vishal Shekhar dance track. After Ta Ra Rum Pum they are again set to storm the charts with dance friendly numbers. Now let’s <u>analyze the whole bundle</u> of the album Cash. The cover has an appealing metallic design which I assume is done to give the metal safe feel. It is elaborate enough to depict amazing pictures, <b style="">lyrics of songs</b> as well as a synopsis but mum in case of giving credits to all the people related to the album. The front cover states that the <u>lyrics are penned by Vishal Dadlani</u>, he has proved his vocal skills with Saainya in Ta Ra Rum Pun now he’ll try to show his wordsmith abilities in this compilation. Other noticeable thing in the cover is <b style="">BIG music</b> don’t know if it’s a sister company of BIG FM 92.7 but lately it has all the big albums under its banner.  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>The album kicks of with the title track <b style="">“Cash”</b> sung by <u>Sunidhi Chauhan</u> and the music director dynamic duo <u>Vishal & Shekhar</u>. As stated earlier it has the 70’s dance feel to it, rhythm is very catchy which makes you sing the song from the first listen but the lyric is hard to get, read the inlay cover for it. Horn sounds, mixture of rap and that fast tempo makes the <u>songs grab attention from the word go</u>. Next on the list is <b style="">“Mind Blowing Mahiya” </b>average efforts to vocalize by <u>Sunidhi</u> again. The synthetic beats woven with the conventional sounds is impressive but it <u>could have been made better</u>. Lyrics are average but who cares about it as long as it’s a 4/4 beat dance track. Subsequently another number is “<b style="">Naa Pucho</b>” by <b style="">Sunidhi and Vishal</b>. This track has all the elements to be a RnB track with the beats, rap to start with and power to make you shake a leg. Techno beats with <b style="">unique instrumentation</b> makes the track stand out.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Consequently I come across <b style="">“Rehem Kare”</b> again crooned by <b style="">Sunidhi and Vishal</b>. The hinglish lyrics still continue to this track as the above tracks. Comparatively easy on the tempo but this songs also has ample beats still let the dance flow alive. At track 5 we have “<b style="">Naughty Naughty</b>”, you are blessed to hear a different female voice than Sunidhi as <u>Anuskha Manchandani</u> effortlessly executes this really naughty number. Vishal has injected his voice in this track as well. The instrument arrangement is very well placed and the lyric is also very fun but <b style=""><u>Hinglish again</u></b>. Another can be item number and a chart topper dance track in the making. Next is the track <b style="">“Zara Bach ke Jee”</b> vocalized with emotions by <u>Anushka Manchanda and Vishal-Shekhar</u> duo. Now you feel like the songs are getting monotonous with same rap in the back, synthetic sound with 4/4 techno beats, Hinglsih lyrics in this track too. Lyrics are also hard to get as there is Hindi, English and Punjabi also now. Zara back ke jee from this song all you listeners. At last we have “<b style="">Cash - Extended Mix</b>” a longer version of the title. It is no different than the title except of some more music and less lyrics. It can be said this songs <u>saves the day </u>at the end. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>On the whole the album seems <b style="">over experimental</b>, <u>Vishal Shekhar also join the bandwagon of music director cum singer </u>by singing in more than half of the song either as rapping in the back or lead singer in the track. May be due to giving lyrics for the first time Vishal’s <b style="">lyrics is just average</b> also being Hinglish almost the whole album but has hampered the overall music of the album, the duo is <u>capable of giving better music than this monotonous album</u>. Another noticeable <b style="">mistake is singer selection</b> for the first half of the album it seems it is a pop album by Sunidhi with Vishal-Shekhar’s music. No variety in song composition as well as listening to the same voices it’s very <b style="">painful to the ear after a while</b> if we try to listen to the whole album. Remixes are not a part of the album, I’m perplexed why! There is only one extended mix but not up to mark for sure. So this album though being layered with dance all the way feel shrills after some listens. <b style="">Pick this album up only if you are a big fan of Vishal-Shekhar and Sunidhi</b> else I don’t recommend the whole album but some tracks are good. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Around 800 Words</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><b style="">Geshan Manandhar</b></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Also availabel at: http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Cash-127929-1.html<br /><b style=""><o:p></o:p></b></p></div>

With the recent controversy of Daler Mehndi singing the title which was replaced by Shankar&#8217;s voice seemed a very good publicity stunt to me. Leaving these things behind <span style="font-weight: bold;">lets scrutinize what the JBJ album complete package</span> is about. You can&#8217;t take your our eyes of the four main actors of the flick jumping in mid air and the black, white and red combination in the cover is just killer. The people are well credited in the inlay and there is a page of each song except the triplet title which<span style="font-style: italic;"> gives you the feel of the album before you put the CD in the CD player</span>.   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">The first promo was provoking itself but let&#8217;s see how well this multi-star movie will earn after hitting the silver screen. Under the Yash Raj Banner, music by the talented Shankar-Ehsan-Loy (SEL) and lyrics by Gulzar I&#8217;ve <span style="font-weight: bold;">more expectation from this album </span>than any other in this season. Following the regular SEL trend this album has 7 tracks in total, a thing to note it states &#8220;It is<span style="">  </span>RECOMMENDED to listen to this ALBUM at the LOUDEST&#8221;.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>The album kicks off with the title which is called &#8221;<b style="">Jhoom</b>&#8221;; it is sung by one third of the terrific trio <u>Shankar Mahadevan</u>. With hum-able lyrics and beats to groove into it asks you to put on your dancing shoes from the word go. Crooned in an astonishing fashion by <u>Neeraj Shridhar and Alisha Chinai</u> next we have &#8221;<b style="">Ticket To Hollywood</b>&#8221;. This is a hip-hopish which has been greatly composed in the 4/4 beat format but the instrumentation still have that authentic Indian flavor. Neeraj Shridhar was the best option for this song, it’s a kind of song that falls in his domain. Subsequently I&#8217;m able to quench my music thirst with &#8221;<b style="">JBJ</b>&#8221; it has been well uttered by <u>Shankar, Jubeen and Sunidhi</u>. This track also keep the dance feel alive, more conventional instruments rule this song and the overall feel has that punch which will make this song a party rocker. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Amazed to read <u>Rahat Fateh Ali Khan&#8217;s</u> name in the back cover of the CD in the consequent song &#8221;<b style="">Bol Na Halke Halke</b>&#8221; <u>Mahalaxmi Iyer </u>makes an impressive mark. Lyrics are exceptional, the composition is simple but flows through your heart from the fist listen. This is my best song in the album I tag it simply spellbinding. The narcotic voice of Rahat has been well complemented by Mahalaxmi, full marks to the music director for singer selection. The only non-dance track in the album but it sets your pulse racing than other track in the compilation. Be ready to stay away from the <b style="">&#8220;Kiss of Love&#8221;</b>,<b style=""><span style="">  </span></b>this<b style=""> </b>number has been amazingly vocalized by <u>Vishal Dadlani</u> and effervescent <u>Vashundara Das</u>. The two VDs execute this track with mushy lyrics and fast beat with almost no flaws at all. Vishal joined the bandwagon of composer turned singers with Saiyaan of Ta Ra Rum Pum but here he utters lovely lyrics for SEL. At track 6 there is &#8221;<b style="">Jhoom Barabar Jhoom</b>&#8221; which is droned by <u>K.K., Sukhwinder Singh, Mahalaxmi Iyer & Shankar Mahadevan </u>as it is similar to the title. The lyrics have been revamped and the music has more punch. It is almost similar to the title track; one can call it a longer dhol mix of the title track with added singers and synthetic sound. Last but not the least we have &#8221;<b style="">Jhoom Jam</b>&#8221; and instrumental that has some snippets of all the above songs. Following the trend as in other albums this is a signature SEL track but this time it has a mix of all the songs included in the album. In my view it’s a articulate way to say the album is coming to an end again listen to the songs as a recap. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>It is a star studded album as the movie where singers from the Paki maestro Rahat to the remake master singer Neeraj are included. It would have been better if the title was sung by Daler as Shanker is lending his voice to 3 tracks in this album with 6 tracks (except of one instrumental). All in all this album meets my expectations and if you are a SEL fan run to the nearest music store and make your copy of this album safe. Then you can rock your home with the foot tapping music the album as to offer. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p><br />Geshan Manandhar</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Around 750 Words</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Also available at</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"> http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Jhoom_Barabar_Jhoom_Album-126038-1.html<br /></p></div>
