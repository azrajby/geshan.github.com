With a sound system of sixty eight thousand watt capacity and dazzling lights placed in by Nepa-Sa, it was sure that the concert would go till dusk. Stated to start at 2:30 PM but the concert got underway only at around 3:30 PM. The hosts Suraj Singh Tahkuri and Mahima Bhattarai were trying to start a competition between Pakistani and Nepali makura. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Then at around 3:45 PM Steam Injuns finally appeared on the stage. Singing around 7 of their popular songs the cool band with a beautiful and talented lady did set the mood for a rocking concert. Consequently X-mantra appeared on the stage at around 4:15 PM. They also had about half a dozen of their popular tracks to offer.<span style="">  </span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Finally the people were about to get what they had paid for, Strings first time Live in <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>. It was already 5:15 PM and the sound checks and setting up the instrument and equipment just started. In quest for the impeccable sound the equipment setup ate up much of the valuable time. The crowd was getting impulsive and curious to hear their favorite Pakistani band without any delay. After all the hustle and bustle, the dynamic duo of Strings ultimately emerged on stage. The crowd roared to the talented Pakistani fiery duo. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Strings started their rocking performance at 6 PM with Chhaye Chhaye from their last album Dhaani, a great rock based track well vocalized by the vocalist, Faisal Kapadia. After it Anjane Kyon (Dekha Tujhe) from Duur charged the crowd with the amazing voice of Bilal Maqsood reacing their ears. Subsequently, the ever popular Na Jane Kyon, OST of Spiderman 2 was sung by Karachi-based band Strings with emotion provoking charisma. People in the crowd couldn’t stop waving their hands to the mesmerizing melody of the song. The crowd followed blindly what ever Kapadia asked them to do. The sight when people were waving their cell phones in air in the twilight was a sight to remember. It was amazing to witness the boys shouting their lungs out in the lyrics of Anjane Kyon.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>After it a relatively old song called Ja Raha was performed by the talented duo. The mixing of Purani Jeans in the middle by Faisal was incredible. Amazingly the crowd response was extraordinary though it had started getting dark but people didn’t stop jumping. The last song was Sar Kiyae an old song from their album Strings2 the song that made them popular initially. It was very unfortunate that the rain gods showered the untimely drizzle and the performance had to be stopped at around 6:45 PM due to technical difficulties. In just minutes the drizzle turned into a heavy downpour but the performance by Strings was an improbable experience. The crowd was not satisfied as they hoped to witness the performance of great tracks like Dhaani, Duur, Soniye, Kahani Mohobatt Ki and others. <span style="background: yellow none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;"></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Strings is a very popular band in <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region></st1:place> as well. They have been voted the most popular Pakistani band in <st1:place st="on">Asia</st1:place>, they received the award of most favorite band award in MTV Asia Awards 2005. The two-man band, comprising vocalist Faisal Kapadia and guitarist Bilal Maqsood are the national ambassadors for HIV-AIDS in <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region> set by UNICEF. Faisal the lead vocalist of strings was born on 29th June 1970<span style="color: rgb(90, 90, 90);font-family:Verdana;font-size:7;"  >.</span> Placing aside his family business he states “I always used music as a tool to escape the Monotony of numbers.“ He always aspired to be in a band. Similarly Bilal Maqsood the guitarist and back vocalist of strings was born on 23rd March 1971. Son of a writer he states “I never thought I&#8217;d take up music as my sole profession”. Bilal the brain of Strings owns a very soothing voice and is listed as one of the best guitarist of <st1:place st="on">Asia</st1:place>.<br /><span style="">            </span>The band was formed way back in 1989 with four guys Faisal, Bilal with two other friends including Rafiq (Who did keyboards and composing then). <span style=""> </span>The four man band released two albums Stings in 1990 and Strings 2 in 1992 but as usual the band broke up… Sar Kiyae Yeh Pahar from Strings 2 was the song to make Strings a household name. The members went to US for further study, two of them were busy in their own professional fields but the energetic duo of Faisal and Bilal wanted to tryout their creative juices. So they decided to reform the band as they completed their bachelors, but after a decade only two of them could make it out of the regular busy life. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>In 2002, the album Duur was released by the reformed two man Strings. Instantly the title track was a big hit. <st1:place st="on"><st1:state st="on">Maine</st1:state></st1:place> tujhe and Sar Kiya Yeh Pahar were two of the popular tracks then Now restricting their composition to a more slow rock pop base the band’s popularity gradually begin to rise. In 2004 they hit the market with Dhaani. Again the title track with the video did the trick. The album was very popular. When their song “Najane Kyon” got selected as an OST for the hollywood movie ‘Spiderman 2’, their fan following expanded to a worldwide form. The song though being in urdu was in sync with the movie. Almost all the songs were visualized and all of them were musical gems. Among the songs Soniye, Chhaye Chhaye and Bolo bolo feat. Hari Haran were just outstanding. Other projects they got involved in were Jeet Lo Dil with Indian band Euphoria in 2004, It was the official song for the Phillips Indo Pak Cricket Series held in <st1:place st="on"><st1:country-region st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place>. In 2006, they sang two numbers for a hindi moive called Zinda. Both songs were composed by Bilal and both had been remixed by DJ and VJ Nikhil of MTV. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>With 5 albums and some amazing projects the band’s popularity has rose up in the last few years. Bagging around twenty five videos under their belt, Strings is the ultimate king of melody, rock and soothing sound mixed for a total satisfying experience. The two guys share a unique chemistry as they have been together for the last 15 years. These guys have performed almost all round the world and were trying to be in <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region> to perform from the last three years. Conclusively it was a short but a rocking performance by the brisk, talented and melodious Strings which was cut off by the untimely rain.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar (Around 1025 words)</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">This is one of the longest things I&#8217;ve ever written. This is unedited one, an edited shortened version was printed in the &#8220;Showbiz&#8221; Magazine Dec 06 Issue. The picture has Prashant, Fiasal and Me, we were lucky to get a picture with him Balal was busy with other things then.

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Multitalented Denil Chitrakar was born on 26 Jestha, 2039 at Bharatpur, Chitwan. Son of a lok song singer Sunil Chitrakar, he has been arranging songs from 2056 BS and till now this has arranged around 60 songs. He has come out with his album khubi which has xx number of songs, which he claims he was able to compile in just 4 months. Basically, the album falls in the pop genre so it has not limitation in the audience aspect. Among his own songs he likes “kina  chhadyou” the most as it is a slow song and has a hum able melody. He claims that his album is distinct from others as he himself has done all the work for the album and his work is orginal. This multifaceted personality is able to compose, arrange and sing as well. He is also interested in dancing, as a kid he was very fond of Michael Jackson’s dance steps and tried imitating the king of pop. Amazingly, he can even do animation. Fact of the matter is he has himself designed the cover for his album.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Denil liked listening to Narayan Gopal as he grew up. He also admires Nepathya, Sanjay Shrestha and Karna Das in the recent times. We can say that music runs in his blood, his grandfather Mr. Nil Bahadur Chitrakar was a classical singer, his father Mr. Sunil Chitrakar used to sing folk songs at Radio <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Then his father also tried his hands on modern songs. His life is like a journey. Born in Bharatpur, he did his schooling at Biratnagar and then arrived to <st1:place st="on">Kathmandu</st1:place> in 2052 BS. His first recorded song happens to be “Mero Sapana Bhitra” when he was in grade 10. He has ten years of working experience in Nepali music scene and he truly opposed the concept of music piracy. He believes that currently in our country a singer cannot sustain his life by just singing but also blames the pirates who pirate music for this situation. He argues that if one listener likes a song s/he should buy the original CD for the promotion of the artist and respect the creation and hardwork of the artist. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            He informs that he didn’t have to go through a struggling period as he used to arrange songs for other artists. He adds that working for the album was a secret until it came out as he used to spend hours on his computer. After completion of the album, he just approached two companies and among the two Situ Digital liked the songs and accepted to market it. He also shares he has had a very good experience with Nepali media. The FM stations have played his songs so as to promote new artist. His first video “Sundari” is also enjoying good air play. He notifies that he has achieved admirable response from our mass media. He also shares that he had a learning experience shooting the video of “Sundari”. He is thankful to his friends Bandhu Adhikari and Ram Kumar for helping whim with the lyrics of some songs of his album.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            In future he tells that he has another video in the pipeline for his song “Kina Chhadyou”. He enlightens that he is not considered a professional singer or an animator. Being very much interested in animation since childhood this arranger turned singer also wants to try his hands in professional animation. He is currently studying Maya at MACC. We wish him more success.

Compiled by DJ Santosh and marketed by Reeyaz music the album cover is very exciting but under informative about the singers and rappers specially.<span style="">  </span>It is startling that the DJ himself has been featured in the video of the first track of the album Chiya Bari Ma. He informs that it was the need of the video and acting is hard.  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>The album initiates with “Chiya Bari Ma”, sung very well by the singer and reinforced equally by the Rapper Sammy. The music is pulsating and the beat matching achieved by the DJ is impressive. Next on the track is “Chandra Surya”, energetic mix of conventional instruments and synthetic sounds with percussive techno beats is lively. But, my personal feeling is that the patriotic song could have been left untouched. After that we have the ever popular “By Road Ko Baato”, this song has a very catchy lyric to start with. The DJ has put vital effort to give it a house mix feel with 4/4 beats. With no doubts it’s simply groovy. Subsequently, we come across “Nachi Deu Maichyang”, the percussion of this song hits you hard. The singers have also poured their heart out to make this song stand our. Next is “Gharbeti Naani”, this song has a urban touch in the beginning but when the lyric is uttered it takes you back to the classics. The captivating rhythm with simple lyrics makes you listen to this song again and again. Then we have the regular 4/4 beat remix called “Maiti Ko Kausi”. It is well vocalized by the singer and I am a big fan of the song’s lyric. On the part of the remix its just the right party starter to set the dancing mood. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>At track 7 we have another controversial number “Bhenda Ko Oon Jasto”, this song has the rocking beats to make anyone jump to the dance floor. The singer can be picked up for some negligible mistakes at times but on the whole the song is pounding. Next on the list is “Jindagani”, the use of flute has made this song truly stand out. Again the blend of beats with standard instrumentation is done seamlessly by the talented DJ. In this song the singer selection could have been better. Consequently we bump into “Saal Ko Paata” it has got all the ingredients to make it a popular dance number. The hard hitting bass beats makes you go wild on the dance floor. The singer has uttered the words skillfully and the lyric is also outstanding. Rappers have also contributed their part to uplift the song. The DJ here deserves 9 out of 10 for this great remix. Next track is “Musu Musu” this is a techno blend of the two songs one in hindi from a movie and the next<span style="">  </span>our own musu musu hansi deu. The singers have completed a remarkable work. Again the beat matching by the DJ seems to be flawless. To conclude we come across “Maichhori Sundari Extended Mix”, with more focus on a power back beginning this song seems to be an instrumental in the beginning. The effort to keep the original sounds intact but still adding new foot tapping beats without polluting the song is admirable. The cross-fade are also actively heard in this song, over all the song is great to put a full stop in any party. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>On the whole the album is better that the earlier Addiction 1. Almost all the tracks have rappers shouting yo and yeh here and there but they do add vitality to the song. Technically, the professionals have executed there job like the professionals. This album should be included in your top 10 party albums. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">Geshan Manandhar (About 650 Word with title)</p><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">Official Details at <a href="http://www.reeyazmusic.com/album.php?name=Addiction2">http://www.reeyazmusic.com/album.php?name=Addiction2</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">I love to write Music Album Reviews.</p><p style="text-align: center;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 51, 0);">Exclusive</span></p></div>

I have to wait till she gets a micro bus and then run home to catch my favorite TV show “The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron”. You might think it sounds like a cartoon, you are right it is a cartoon show. Previously aired on 5:15 pm now at 5:45 it has eased off the pressure a lot. You might ask why a guy past teen age still watches cartoon!!!  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, an American animated television series, is a spin-off of the Oscar-nominated computer-animated movie; Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, first officially aired in September 2002. This is also the first computer-animated Nicktoon. The first time I watched it, it was in the middle I just loved the graphics. The graphics was great the characters amusing and the comedy very much for the masses not only for the small children. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">The central character is Jimmy Neutron, in the town of <st1:city st="on">Retroville</st1:city>, <st1:state st="on"><st1:place st="on">Texas</st1:place></st1:state>, who gets in and out of trouble by inventing far-out gadgets. Jimmy&#8217;s main catchphrases are &#8220;Gotta Blast!&#8221;, and &#8220;Brain Blast!&#8221;, or simply the most overused phrase, &#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221;, after coming up with the ultimate idea to solve the problem. Jimmy typically has a &#8220;Brain Blast&#8221; once an episode at the climax of the story when all other ideas have failed, and it is accompanied by a visual of his ideas floating within the inner workings of his brain.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">He is ten year old genius inventor whose inventions tend to cause more destruction than help, and usually it&#8217;s up to Jimmy to save the day against his own creations. He has an extensive laboratory below his clubhouse which is accessed via hair DNA scan. Carl and Sheen are his best friends. He has a robotic dog named Goddard. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">His never ending fights with Cindy Vortex are another interesting aspect of the show. Though they love each other from inside due to peer pressure and other reasons they always fight. I just love the sequences between those two. On my recommendation many of my friends have added Jimmy to their never miss shows. We all need a way to relax; in reality it’s not possible to relax at the max so in fiction and in cartoon it’s just out of the way to let your imaginations flow. That’s why I love to watch Jimmy, it’s the no. 1 in my rankings just give it a try at 5:45 PM Tuesday-Friday on Nickelodeon channel and feel it for yourself. As far as I can I never miss it, It’s a show that will engulf you in itself for half and hour, try it to believe it.</div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"></div>Geshan Manandhar<br />Around 450 Words<br />I had even Made a website http://jimmyneutron.ifastnet.com using Drupal but couldn&#8217;t update it due to lack of time, If you people like Jimmy and want to help me you are welcome. See the website it has problems still.</div></div>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">You as Mero Mobile user, may have surfed the internet via your GPRS (Global Packet Radio Service) enabled mobile handsets. But have you wondered what GPRS is?</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="">  </span>GPRS (Global Packet Radio Service) is a mobile data service available to users of GSM (Global System for Mobile) mobile phones. It is often described as &#8220;2.5G&#8221;, that is, a technology between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony. It provides moderate speed data transfer, by using unused TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) channels in the GSM network. GPRS is a mobile data service which utilizes packet switching. It means that multiple users share the same transmission channel, only transmitting when they have data to send. This means that the total available bandwidth can be immediately dedicated to those users who are actually sending at any given moment, providing higher utilization where users only send or receive data intermittently. Web browsing, receiving e-mails as they arrive and instant messaging are examples of uses that require intermittent data transfers, which benefit from sharing the available bandwidth. Usually, GPRS data are billed per kilobytes of information transceived. Mero mobile (Spice <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>) charges Rs 0.20 for every 10 Kb traffic or Rs 750 Per month for unlimited access. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">GPRS is a connectivity solution based on Internet Protocols that supports a wide range of enterprise and consumer applications. With throughput rates of up to 40 kbit/s, users have a similar access speed to a dial-up modem, but with the convenience of being able to connect from anywhere. In addition to the IP (Internet Protocol), GPRS supports X.25, a packet-based protocol that is used mainly in Europe. GPRS is an evolutionary step toward EDGE (Enhanced Data GSM Environment) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telephone Service). Almost all the new cell phone models support GPRS; some models that support GPRS are Nokia 6100, Sony Eriksson 300i, Samsung D500, LG D2100. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">EDGE (Enhanced Data GSM Environment), a faster version of the GSM wireless service, is designed to deliver data at rates up to 384 Kbps and enable the delivery of multimedia and other broadband applications to mobile phone. The EDGE standard is built on the existing GSM standard, using the same TDMA frame structure and existing cell arrangements. The Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA) states that, as of April 2006, there were 139 commercial GSM/EDGE networks in 78 countries, out of a total of 192 EDGE deployments in 102 countries. The regional breakdown of commercial EDGE networks is 59 in Europe, 45 in the Americas and Caribbean, 21 in Asia, and 14 in Africa and the Middle East. GPRS is the present and EDGE may be the future, let&#8217;s hope we would also step up to EDGE some day.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;">By Geshan Manandhar </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;">About 450 Words</p>  Published on &#8220;In YOur Face&#8221; Magazine July 2007 Issue, Now NTC is also launching GPRS in near Future for Pre-Paid users and its available for Post-Paid Users.</div>
