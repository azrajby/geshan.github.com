  </header>


  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">Common is defined as shared by or coming from more than one or belonging to whole community by the oxford dictionary. In the current context commons is a concept that underlines the idea of any common resource that is available to all but can be locally defined or specifically as &#8220;everybody belongs to category x&#8221;. Commons is an age old tradition mainly practiced in the East/south. Like the common village land, common water source etc. Similarly, commons is of two types primarily they are physical resource and human made resource. Human made resource can incorporate a body of information which is part of a culture and intellectual heritage.<br /><br />Commons is almost synonymous to public domain. So what is public domain then, public domain comprises of body of knowledge and innovation in relation to which no person or other legal entity can establish or maintain proprietary interests within a particular legal jurisdiction. The good and the bad side of public domain resource is, in general anyone may use or exploit the resource whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes. In general understanding, an item of work is not is public domain it may be result of a proprietary interest such as copyright, patent or other rights. So a resource in a public domain is very important to the commoner who is interested to use the resource in any form. The figure below attempts to explain the commons in a better way.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SAS8Gm4NqzI/AAAAAAAAAVo/gWktQ7yW5eI/s1600-h/Commons_Resource_Pool.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SAS8Gm4NqzI/AAAAAAAAAVo/gWktQ7yW5eI/s400/Commons_Resource_Pool.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5189479492339215154" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center;" /></a><br />Commons or common resource is beneficial to the commoners. But on the negative side if the common resource has probability to be depleted mainly on following grounds:</div><ol style="text-align: justify;"><br /><li> Privatization of resource (Mainly via use of intellectual property rights IPR)</li><br /><li> Over Consumption</li><br /><li> No way to replenish the commons</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Lets take a simple example, water is supposed to be a common resource so why do we pay for water to the government. Can we say that there won’t be a day when the government won’t charge us for clean air in this case of over pollution? Let’s hope that day does not come.<br /><br />Let’s analyze how intellectual property rights like copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret help growth reduction. The validity of a copyright for a book is life of author plus 70 years in current context. So after lets say about 140 years the resource comes back to the public domain. But core businessmen are trying to make the validity infinity minus 1 day which is bound to create problems. For further information please see www.copyright.gov on how copyright is certain to create troubles.<br /><br /><br />On a technical base let’s try to define digital commons. Digital commons are those intellectual properties specifically in digital form and in the public domain. Digital commons tries to define in concrete terms that everyone is able to enjoy the digital revolution.  It mainly advocates about the free and open source software, open source software and creative commons. The figure below tries to clarify the commons concept with copyright and copyleft.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SAS8Y24Nq0I/AAAAAAAAAVw/MTuF0aMJcY0/s1600-h/Copyleft_Copyright_Spectrum.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/SAS8Y24Nq0I/AAAAAAAAAVw/MTuF0aMJcY0/s400/Copyleft_Copyright_Spectrum.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5189479805871827778" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center;" /></a><br />An amazing fact about copyright © is that we don’t even have to mention copyright © Name and year to mark that we have the copyright of the creation or resource it is implicit by law. So if nothing is mentioned then it means copyright automatically. It is the restriction to copy or use the resource in any form. But commons is a transparent concept there by in the software world people like Richard Stallman and others advocated the concept of free software, free not as in cost but the freedom to use and modify. Free software is a software which is in the public domain for eternity. The free software foundation germinated licenses like GNU GPL (GNU Not Unix General Public License) and GNU FDL (GNU Not Unix Free Document License) that made it possible to use the software, distribute or redistribute it and make modifications to the existing software and as per condition sell it as well.<br /><br />Other that the GNU licenses there is another license called Creative Commons (CC) it mainly talks of following things, which are</div><ol style="text-align: justify;"><br /><li> Attribution : Attribute the original author of the content</li><br /><li>Derivative : Allow derivative work of the resource</li><br /><li>Commercial : Allow or not allow commercial use of the resource</li><br /><li>Share Alike: The resource can be modified but should be given back in the same license it is take from the commons.</li></ol><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br />There by rather than going towards the conventional copyright we must break the barrier by collaborative work that gives rise to the age old and proven concept of commons.<br /><br />Geshan Manandhar<br />Around 850 Words</div></div></div>

Quoting singing as his habit but he is well versed to sing without any formal training in singing or playing instruments. On the contrary he can and loves to play guitar which he tags as his favorite instrument. He supplements that it’s the base of composition and is lady shaped. He defines music as an integral part of life. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            He was born on November 14 in <st1:place st="on">Kathmandu</st1:place>. Asif completed his schooling from <st1:place st="on"><st1:placename st="on">Everest</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype st="on">School</st1:placetype></st1:place>. He joined <st1:place st="on"><st1:placename st="on">Ashirwad</st1:placename> <st1:placetype st="on">College</st1:placetype></st1:place> to do his +2 in commerce and was admitted to Shanker Dev for BBS but did it from Public Youth. He is fast to tell that the callers on his how identify him as a student of Public Youth. He happily admits that his music career started just by joking but informs that he had to struggle to be the television presenter that he is in current times. He states that singing is a common family hobby and he liked listening to Michael Learns To Rock, Ronan Keating from the West and Shaan and Sonu Nigam from the East growing up as a teenager.  </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            He has tried his hands in works of television producer, video and advertisement director, television presenter, singer and even recently as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">RJ.</span> He explains that a <span style="font-weight: bold;">TV producer</span> is the one who shoots, edits and airs a program so he can be termed the <span style="font-style: italic;">Captain of the ship</span>. He as successfully produces shows like Lifestyle, Music of your choice, SMS and more and others. He has worked for many Nepali TV channels like Channel <st1:country-region st="on">Nepal</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region> 1, Kantipur and Image Televison. He swiftly denies his interest in National Television.  As a video director this prolific performer has more than 25 videos under his belt among them his personal favorite is “Jindagi Ma” of Nabin K. Bhattarai which got critical acclamation. Some popular videos directed by the gifted individual are Aankha Bhari by Pranil feat. DA 69, Namuna by Mingma Sherpa, Saathi by Sugam Pokhrel, Yehi ho ta maya by Pranil feat. Nabin K. Bhattarai, and the recent talk of the town she is the bomb by the Unity.

The album contains 8 tracks of which the video of Pahilo Maya is a chart topper. The album will be released under the name of Unity of which Asif is an indispensable part. He adds that he has no plans of singing rap but audience will find variety in the album. He clarifies that all songs will be like Pahilo Maya where Asif will sing and the songs will have rap. It has a mix of genres including RnB, Rap, Rock etc. The album’s songs are composed by Asif, Swapnil of Shadows and Sugam Pokhrel has also helped for one song. The whole album’s arrangement credits is to be credited to Rajan Ishan. Asif is quick to say that Nepali music scenario is going well and now is the era of experimental and quality music. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">On being asked about his career he notifies that the balancing act between his careers is spontaneous. It is hectic but hassle free as Unity is a team and the singing he does is a part of the team work that eases his pressure. He doesn’t term his as a singer as only a single is out so he likes to be known as a TV presenter. He denies being <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jack of all and master of none</span> with example that we study commerce with many subjects like Marketing, English, and Mathematics etc but to pass we must get good marks in all of them. So, people tell me that I’m putting my hands in many things but as the study of many subjects I can handle it very well. He updates that he has no big future plans except to work for and promote his album in immediate future. Finally he puts forward his gratitude to all the fans and supporters and says that he would like any kind of comments, suggestion and compliments.

Now the multifaceted celebrity is more into arranging then in singing. Defining arranging as a job of a makeup artist where the composition of a song is a bride, he exclaims that arranger is the main person responsible for instrumentation in any song in current context.  </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Born on Asoj 13, 2033 Ishan did his schooling in various schools including Laboratory school, kshitiz school and he completed his schooling in <st1:place st="on"><st1:city st="on">Ranchi</st1:city>, <st1:country-region st="on">India</st1:country-region></st1:place> in Central Academy Siddhartha Institue. He joined colleges like RR campus,Lalit kala and Shanker Dev campus but didn’t really put his heat and soul in studies. He was more focused into music mainly from 2047 BS. About his music career he informs that he was in sports first, he was a black belt in Karate. Unknowingly he shifted from sports to music.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">He states now he has no time to listen to songs but he used to listen to Mohamad Rafi, Manna de, Kishore Kumar and Mehendi Hasan. He was also a fan of Scorpians, Michael learns to rock and Brian Adams in the yesteryears. Amongst the various instruments he knows to play like mouthorgan, bansure (murali), guitar, drum, madal, keyboard, dholak and harmonium he likes the guitar most. He says it was the first instrument he learned and he is attached to it more. Ishan had formal trainings for guitar and basic classical course from Nhyoo Bajracharya in Doremi. He has also done Jr. Diploma in Eastern classical music.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Struggle has not been a part and parcel of life for Rajan but he has got his share of working experience required to be a successful arranger he is now. He was an assistant in Alpha Digital Studio where he learnt the recording related tasks. He worked as a recordist in Opus studio and Royaltone studio. He had opened his own studio called Naad but now he has his home studio named Virtual Studio at Sucheka Galli, Ason. He emphasized that work should be done sincerely. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Rajan Ishan as a singer has released two solo albums Rohini vol. 1 (2054 BS) and Ishan (2059 BS). He has also brought out an album as a member of the band Nishad called Nishad (2055 BS) itself. As an arranger he has bagged fifty songs under his belt. Some of the popular numbers he has arranged are “Basama Chhaina”, “Chham Chham”, Namuna, “Priyatama”, “Pahilo maya” and “Kahile aago” and “Maan ko rani” in recent times. Rajan likes to have a versatile approach on arrangement of songs and wants to be variety oriented. He thanks god for making him able to arrange such diverse songs from pop to RnB. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">He achieved the best new artist award in Hits FM Music awards 2056. The well admired video of “Basa Ma Chhaina” got the award of best video in SanMiguel Awards in 2056 bagged by Alok Nembang. He has also done jingles for advertisements including the recent advertisement of Quick Chips which features “Basa Ma Chhiana”. He is doing advert jingles for Hama Steel and Ricona as well. There by he has got his hands involved in many fields. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Though he is not in the limelight, he is ahead to say that he is not media shy. He likes to be known as a good compose and arranger. He wants himself to be called as a music director who is a complete package in his own rights. In the pipeline we have Mausami Gurung’s new album, Yash Kumar’s album, Unity’s Next album called Byakaran, Sugam Pokhrel’s next album called Paathshala and Aau mero saath by Satish Shrestha which are all arranged by Rajan. The list of songs will soon reach the century mark when he arranges songs for<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Agantuk Kharel of which Ban Ma Fulyo Phool is rocking the charts now a days</span>, his own next album, Dhiraj Rai and Satya Swarup Shrestha. In the year 2064 he aims that in the top ten song of the year the top five will be arranged by him. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">This down to earth humble human being has changed with time. A decade back he arranged slow song like “Basama chhaina” and how he has arranged hit numbers like Maan ko rani and Pahilo Maya. He claims that now the era is of RnB, hip hop with 4/4 beats so songs should be short in lengthy and catchy from the word go.  He also adds that this is the golden period in Nepali music and presence on many Medias has helped uplift Nepali music to this level. He is happy that just by arranging in our country also a person can survive easily. This believer in god stresses on positive thinking and healthy living.

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RhCzLH5Rk-I/AAAAAAAAAB0/y8-LEuTDg_w/s1600-h/Geshan_N_Goher_Jal_Interview_EV_Small.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RhCzLH5Rk-I/AAAAAAAAAB0/y8-LEuTDg_w/s320/Geshan_N_Goher_Jal_Interview_EV_Small.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5048732185961534434" style="cursor: pointer; float: right; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px;" /></a><br /><o:p></o:p>       It was 18<sup>th</sup> December 2006, I had got a call last night on 17<sup>th</sup> December 2006 that I may have to take Jal’s interview from my friend who works for In your face magazine. I had contributed an article for that mag in the past. I work till 1 AM to jot down the questions to ask the ever popular young and energetic band whose life performance I witnessed just two days back on 16<sup>th</sup> December 2006. I am a fan of jal for that matter.     <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            The day arrives, in the morning I’m informed to reach the parking of Hyatt at 10. I reach there on time, thing to consider is that I have an exam (viva) to give at 11:30 or 12:00. There seems to a miscommunication but we are informed that Jal has gone for a mountain flight. To no avail, we wait for an hour or so. Then the Jal’s manager inform us they are coming. He meant that they are coming down from their room but we scanned every incoming vehicle to sum up the work. Then Jal’s manager was behaving so good with us.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            After around two hours of endless waiting, the terrific trio of Jal finally arrive at the lobby of Hyatt. I run to the lead vocalist Salman Butt and ask him to give me few minutes. Goher is a litter far and Shazi is in his own world. Just as I begin to ask the first question the chameleon nature of the manager shows, he is so eager to move. Informs me that they are getting late. He had ensured that he will provide 10 minutes or so but I had to sum up the interview in just 1:45 mins with just two questions asked. I was so unsatisfied as my hard work was unjustified and I still had a exam to give. Another point to notice is that Mr. Butt didn’t feel the need to stop smoking while answering my question. Do you call this Jal (Manger mainly)’s disrespect to media or what? I really wished that they missed their flight!!!! A ray of hope they had the decency to wave us bye.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            The next day I get the anchor story of THT(The Himalayan Times) that ‘Jal’s manager is held with illegal notes’ I was so happy. Let’s put it aside but I’m a big fan of Jal. The way they treated a media person was reprehensible. If they had told they won’t give the interview we could have returned, they didn’t value our time. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p>            Nonetheless, today 27<sup>th</sup> December 2006 I again get a call when I’m returning home from college. I just find out that I have to interview the creative genius behind Jal – Goher Mumtaz only as others have returned and Manager is still in custody. I was per-informed about this so I had prepared the questions; I jump home print the question and head for the interview at 6. Reach a hotel at Jwalakhel and landed in Goher Mumtaz’s room. He was watching cricket at that time. This man is truly talented no doubts about that as he is the lyricist, lead and rhythm guitarist and above all composes the songs for Jal. Buts still on the contrary to my bitter experience 9 days back he is down to earth and humble. Primarily, the interview as very good, I have recorded it. He did smoke but had the decorum to blow the smoke away from me. A fine-looking tall gifted artist being perplexed by my question was what I enjoyed the most in today’s interview. All in all I must add you must set aside the emotion and feelings in professional life to a level, or it forbids you from giving your best shot. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">         <br />          This was the bitter and sweet experience I had with interviewing Jal. Hope it was likable. If I get the photos I’ll add them up.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p><br />Geshan Manandhar</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Around 650 Words</div></div></div>
