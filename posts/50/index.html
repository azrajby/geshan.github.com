<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">You as Mero Mobile user, may have surfed the internet via your GPRS (Global Packet Radio Service) enabled mobile handsets. But have you wondered what GPRS is?</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="">  </span>GPRS (Global Packet Radio Service) is a mobile data service available to users of GSM (Global System for Mobile) mobile phones. It is often described as &#8220;2.5G&#8221;, that is, a technology between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony. It provides moderate speed data transfer, by using unused TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) channels in the GSM network. GPRS is a mobile data service which utilizes packet switching. It means that multiple users share the same transmission channel, only transmitting when they have data to send. This means that the total available bandwidth can be immediately dedicated to those users who are actually sending at any given moment, providing higher utilization where users only send or receive data intermittently. Web browsing, receiving e-mails as they arrive and instant messaging are examples of uses that require intermittent data transfers, which benefit from sharing the available bandwidth. Usually, GPRS data are billed per kilobytes of information transceived. Mero mobile (Spice <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>) charges Rs 0.20 for every 10 Kb traffic or Rs 750 Per month for unlimited access. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">GPRS is a connectivity solution based on Internet Protocols that supports a wide range of enterprise and consumer applications. With throughput rates of up to 40 kbit/s, users have a similar access speed to a dial-up modem, but with the convenience of being able to connect from anywhere. In addition to the IP (Internet Protocol), GPRS supports X.25, a packet-based protocol that is used mainly in Europe. GPRS is an evolutionary step toward EDGE (Enhanced Data GSM Environment) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telephone Service). Almost all the new cell phone models support GPRS; some models that support GPRS are Nokia 6100, Sony Eriksson 300i, Samsung D500, LG D2100. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">EDGE (Enhanced Data GSM Environment), a faster version of the GSM wireless service, is designed to deliver data at rates up to 384 Kbps and enable the delivery of multimedia and other broadband applications to mobile phone. The EDGE standard is built on the existing GSM standard, using the same TDMA frame structure and existing cell arrangements. The Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA) states that, as of April 2006, there were 139 commercial GSM/EDGE networks in 78 countries, out of a total of 192 EDGE deployments in 102 countries. The regional breakdown of commercial EDGE networks is 59 in Europe, 45 in the Americas and Caribbean, 21 in Asia, and 14 in Africa and the Middle East. GPRS is the present and EDGE may be the future, let&#8217;s hope we would also step up to EDGE some day.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;">By Geshan Manandhar </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;">About 450 Words</p>  Published on &#8220;In YOur Face&#8221; Magazine July 2007 Issue, Now NTC is also launching GPRS in near Future for Pre-Paid users and its available for Post-Paid Users.</div>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Web 2.0 or simply web2 hasn’t caught the hype in our country but is the next big thing in developed nations. In the yesteryears the concept of websites flowed like this, one information provider and many information consumers. But it is a different setting in the present circumstance, now there are many information producers/providers and many information consumers which create a many to many information sharing base. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Web 2.0 may seem like a very technical word trying to specify the version 2 of the current web infrastructure that is becoming a part of our high tech life. But it is not, Web 2.0 is a word coined by O&#8217;Reilly Media in the year 2004, that refers to the supposed second-generation of Internet-based services that let people collaborate and share information online in perceived new ways such as social networking sites, wikis, communication tools, and folksonomies. So Web 2.0 is straightforward and clear concept that advocates the websites should be a platform where all the visitors can actively participate. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">It is quite clear that Web 2.0 primarily focuses on open content and is supportive to open source. Giving emphasis on community, it is encouraging collaborative works. Hence eventually Web 2.0 tries to achieve information for the people & by the people, so as to parting the traditional Web 1.0 environment where content provider was only one and information consumers were many. In Web 2.0 the numbers of information provides and consumers will be almost same. Web 2.0 is a concept that persuades website viewers to participate and feel the belongingness to the website or the web application.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">So you might be asking what are the concrete differences in the new concept Web 2.0 and the earlier one? The answers unfold here, earlier we used to peruse through the Britannica Online encyclopedia where one who is reading if s/he finds new things on that topic is directly not able to add or alter any content but in Wikipedia it is easily possible. In any topic by collaborative effort we get great articles from wikipedia that also at no cost and no legal difficulties. Previously people used to have personal websites, now it is the era of blogging. <span style="" lang="EN">A <span style="">weblog</span>, which is usually shortened to <span style="">blog</span>, is a type of website where entries are made (such as in a journal or diary), displayed in a reverse chronological order.</span><span lang="EN"> </span>Thus, personal websites have now turned in to blogs the personal web diary of people.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Commercially, people paid for advertisement or other pages on the basis of page view but now in web 2.0 the cost is charged on the basis of cost per click. Earlier it was the concept of publishing and not letting anyone comment on it or even copy it. But now in web 2.0 the concept of participation has prevailed. In web 1.0 there used to be directories or taxonomy of the links and all other things but now it’s the age of tagging or folksonomy with a community effort. The lacking social aspect in the websites has been incredibly stressed in the new concept of web 2.0.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">As the websites based on the web 2.0 concept look forward for the participation of all the interested people so it focuses on simple design but rich features. The feature rich interface will give the even novice web users their space to participate in the website. One Nepali website that is totally based on web 2.0 and provides features like blogging, commenting on the text etc etc is <a href="http://fossnepal.org/">http://fossnepal.org</a>. If you know about Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) it is a must see for you, if you don’t know about FOSS then it is a compulsory visit for you.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Eagerly let’s hope that all the websites and webmasters will get the concept of Web 2.0 in near future. Going to Web 2.0 does not mean that you just add a guest book and it’s done. I’m not even advising that all website should follow web 2.0 as a company websites need not follow web 2.0. But if the webmasters transform their Web 1.0 websites to the new Web 2.0 it will be beneficial to both parties the developers and the website visitors. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">About 700 Words</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">This article was published on &#8220;In Your Face&#8221; Magazine Feb 06 Issue.<br /></span></p><br /><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"></p></div>

It’s a small and very handy phone with many the features. Being a Nokia product it emphasizes on user friendliness.<span style="">  </span>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Undoubtedly, it has very good sound quality. The reception of signals is also fine. The battery life is also satisfactory. The best thing about this phone is that it’s small and very well designed. Just fits in my palm and easy to operate. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Only one game is available chess puzzle when you buy it. It supports USB connection to a computer via a data cable from which you can transfer data is that given space of 256 Kb for polyphonic midi ring tones, pictures and application (games).<span style="">  </span>The organizer is also a handy tool to use; I have many day notes and remainder for jobs. Writing messages is also easy. Alarm clock, calculator comes in very useful. This GPRS (Global Packet Radio Service) enabled phone give me comprehensive access to the internet on need. I am addicted to changing the wallpaper and ring tone almost daily.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">The point I am not satisfied with is that it instantly stores the numbers in phone memory. Other than that the 8 channel midi ring tone playback is also somewhat lame. Though a color mobile, but the display is not up to the mark as it is 256 color display. Playing graphic intensive games on this phone is not that satisfying. It says it has infrared but I don’t know the service point in the phone. If anyone knows please inform me. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">All in all, the phone is a must have for the person who wants a color mobile without extra features associated with a camera. If you don’t want a feature rich phone with mp3 player, FM, sound recording and video recording this is the best color mobile for you. I find more pros then cons in this model. It is really value for money, after it’s a Nokia product, which connects people. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Around 350 Words</p><p class="MsoNormal"> It was written in June 2006, so may be a not that proficient in use of language.<br /></p></div>

<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RgP2Y9lXWWI/AAAAAAAAABA/pqsL9cSPrZk/s1600-h/platina_GM.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RgP2Y9lXWWI/AAAAAAAAABA/pqsL9cSPrZk/s320/platina_GM.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5045146916293663074" border="0" /></a>After an intensive research in the 100 CC segment I had to opt for Bajaj Platina. Why you’ll find it later. The great contenders included some models from TVS, Hero Honda, LML which may even fall in the 125 CC class but I had to choose a cool bike with great mileage. As the advertisement states it has killer looks and the style with 108 KMPL fuel efficiency. It states 108 KMPL but currently in the first month has given only 50-60 KMPL, it was stated by the company that it will give only upto 55 KMPL before the first servicing. I have rode 600 KMs in about a month, I really want to witness how it performs overtime.   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>The killer looks include premium alloy wheels, matt finished black silencer, sporty console, sleek chrome graphics, graphite tinted engine and transmission and chrome streaked side panels. With the new exhaus-TEC engine it is bound to perform well. The SNS suspension does give you a great riding pleasure. The handling and braking is very good in this brand new stage but it will be tested as the time passes. From almost all angles the bike resembles Wind 125 but has no self start like the Discover. It does make heads turn but if it had a self start it would have been a complete bike. I assume it’s built on the old caliber engine which has power for sure but does make the irritating gear shift sounds.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>With a tank capacity of 13 liters I’m freed from going to the petrol pump almost every alternate day as I used to ride the <st1:street st="on"><st1:address st="on">Hero Honda Street</st1:address></st1:street> Smart with tank capacity of just 3.5 liters I suppose. It has a mild sound not like the bold sounds of the Hero Honda model’s but doesn’t lack the always needed pickup and speed. The first gear is very powerful, but again clutch balance is what I didn’t learn easily on this machine. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Small things to consider, the rubber pad on foot brake is a very good small addition that caught my attention. The ride control on/off does work, it can be used to shift from economy and power mode formidably. The leg guard is very primitive so it had to be upgraded. Again the gear shifting makes lots of noise, the chain cover also emits unneeded noise. The gear shifting lever is pushed inside, which leads to the plastic styling being scratched by the shoes when gears are changed. The kick is regular L shaped which is easy to kick rather that the C shaped kick we find in Discover, but it should not affect as discover has self start. The side lamps as of all the Bajaj models are over stretched, looks very good but is prone to breakage. Tyres have no such defect till date; the ride experience on the whole is a good one.<span style="">  </span>Reading above paragraph you might think I regret the decision of buying this baby, but not I’m a very good critic as people say. The price of one lakh two thousand Nepali currency (equate to Rs. 63750 IC, which you people can get in a lot cheaper now at Rs 34000 IC, its very expensive here in Kathmandu, Nepal because of all the taxes) is well set for this motorbike. I love the alloy wheels and the bike’s performance even in busy roads. The bike has good speed when it comes to riding in the open roads. I have traveled around 60 KMs in a single day but the bike showed no sighs of slowing down which I liked, I know it is also because it is new. <st1:place st="on">Battery</st1:place> is also performing standard though I have put this bike under the rain few times but it hasn’t given any trouble. The side lamps switch is hip to operate, the key cover in ignition and fuel tank is logical. The oil indictor under the engine is a feature that is unique to this model. The horn also sound ok, it is not too sharp and irritating like that of the Pulsar or Discover.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Overall the bike has no such features like self start, disc brakes but for a bike priced right with 108 KMPL it is the best option you can get in the market. </p>  Geshan Manandhar<br />Around 725 Words</div>

Starting off in a desert and train scenario it ends up in… wait, what’s the fun if I tell you how it ends. Shot is various locations like Brazil, Nambia’s Desert, Mumbai, an old for in India etc this film has amazingly projected the two curvaceous beauties Aish and Bips in a glamorous manner.   </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Coming to the guys <b>Hrithik is simply the best in this movie</b>. He is the style guru with no doubts, acts like a veteran and gives action sequences as it was a piece of cake. Abhishek has an amusing entry as per me and acts well but seems a little bossy at times as his character. Uday is similar to the last Dhoom but his character has <b>added the zing of comedy</b> in this intense but still in vogue movie. There are no such supporting actors who stand out as the film revolves mainly on the leading 5. Rimi Sen puts of a good show in her small role. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            The good points about the film can be tagged as <b>the technical work</b>. The <b>camera has been handled by an experienced person</b> the <b>editor also has magic in his hands</b>. Some camera angles in the breath taking locations are out of this world. Equally the <b>actors have also provided a formidable act</b>. The <b>background music by Salim-Sulemaan is the icing on the cake;</b> do have to tell anything about the <b>music by Pritam its</b> <b>just pulsating</b>. The <b>screenplay is also up to the mark</b> while the ending could have been much better, I sense there is a space left for Dhoom3 as well. <b>Choreography  Viavhabi Merchant is also astounding</b>, Hrithik is a fabulous dancer but Aish dances great when she is alone in the video with Hrithik she loose her composure aplomb. My favourite scene is the one with Hrithik, Aish and the gun.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Now the things I consider not that good in the film. The special effects is the first thing I want to include this list. I say <b>special effect is like a drug, best when you know how much and when to use it</b>. I don’t complain that the special effects are bad but at some point it <b>seems very unrealistic and kind of unnecessary</b>. About the actors <b>Bipasha lacks the poise</b> in some shots and in “touch me” the song. <b>Aish is looking skinny</b> in most part of the film but looks portly at the end, portly because she looks a little fat than regular. <b>Uday Chopra over acts</b> at some stages and <b>Jr. Bachan should have been built</b> <b>regarding his physique</b> for a role like this but he is OK. The only cool guy in this gang is Hrithik, he is just impeccable. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Now writing about the clothes, style, the gadgets including bikes and cars. The chopper looks very real in film just joking. All the stars are shining brighter just due to the skillful stylist. Everyone has dream to get clothes on them. Here also <b>Hrithik</b> steals the show, I read that <b>he as 17 looks in the film</b>. I haven’t counted but his disguises are simply flawless and so in sync with the movie. Other actors also put up a good show regarding style and carrying it off. <b>Gadgets are cool </b>as in the previous version. To a level it seems you are overdoing with the gadgets but the bike race in the end is sure to thrill you. Oh did I let something out already. For more detail information run to a theater near you.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            To sum up, this movie if better than Dhoom. In simple words a paisa wasool movie and a must watch in the theater. <b>Grab your friends and let the reel roll</b>. </div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Around 675 Words</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Can be found at <a href="http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Dhoom_2-114905-1.html">http://www.mouthshut.com/review/Dhoom_2-114905-1.html</a></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><br /></div></div></div>
