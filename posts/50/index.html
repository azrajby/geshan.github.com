  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Multitalented Denil Chitrakar was born on 26 Jestha, 2039 at Bharatpur, Chitwan. Son of a lok song singer Sunil Chitrakar, he has been arranging songs from 2056 BS and till now this has arranged around 60 songs. He has come out with his album khubi which has xx number of songs, which he claims he was able to compile in just 4 months. Basically, the album falls in the pop genre so it has not limitation in the audience aspect. Among his own songs he likes “kina  chhadyou” the most as it is a slow song and has a hum able melody. He claims that his album is distinct from others as he himself has done all the work for the album and his work is orginal. This multifaceted personality is able to compose, arrange and sing as well. He is also interested in dancing, as a kid he was very fond of Michael Jackson’s dance steps and tried imitating the king of pop. Amazingly, he can even do animation. Fact of the matter is he has himself designed the cover for his album.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            Denil liked listening to Narayan Gopal as he grew up. He also admires Nepathya, Sanjay Shrestha and Karna Das in the recent times. We can say that music runs in his blood, his grandfather Mr. Nil Bahadur Chitrakar was a classical singer, his father Mr. Sunil Chitrakar used to sing folk songs at Radio <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>. Then his father also tried his hands on modern songs. His life is like a journey. Born in Bharatpur, he did his schooling at Biratnagar and then arrived to <st1:place st="on">Kathmandu</st1:place> in 2052 BS. His first recorded song happens to be “Mero Sapana Bhitra” when he was in grade 10. He has ten years of working experience in Nepali music scene and he truly opposed the concept of music piracy. He believes that currently in our country a singer cannot sustain his life by just singing but also blames the pirates who pirate music for this situation. He argues that if one listener likes a song s/he should buy the original CD for the promotion of the artist and respect the creation and hardwork of the artist. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            He informs that he didn’t have to go through a struggling period as he used to arrange songs for other artists. He adds that working for the album was a secret until it came out as he used to spend hours on his computer. After completion of the album, he just approached two companies and among the two Situ Digital liked the songs and accepted to market it. He also shares he has had a very good experience with Nepali media. The FM stations have played his songs so as to promote new artist. His first video “Sundari” is also enjoying good air play. He notifies that he has achieved admirable response from our mass media. He also shares that he had a learning experience shooting the video of “Sundari”. He is thankful to his friends Bandhu Adhikari and Ram Kumar for helping whim with the lyrics of some songs of his album.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            In future he tells that he has another video in the pipeline for his song “Kina Chhadyou”. He enlightens that he is not considered a professional singer or an animator. Being very much interested in animation since childhood this arranger turned singer also wants to try his hands in professional animation. He is currently studying Maya at MACC. We wish him more success. You can contact his at denil_c@hotmail.com . </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Geshan Manandhar</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">(Around 600 Word)</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">I had taken an interview to jot up this Artist Profile, Next will be of Asif Shah (Took his interview for the profile too) will be here,as soon as it gets published in &#8220;Neo Showbiz&#8221; Magazine.

Compiled by DJ Santosh and marketed by Reeyaz music the album cover is very exciting but under informative about the singers and rappers specially.<span style="">  </span>It is startling that the DJ himself has been featured in the video of the first track of the album Chiya Bari Ma. He informs that it was the need of the video and acting is hard.  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>The album initiates with “Chiya Bari Ma”, sung very well by the singer and reinforced equally by the Rapper Sammy. The music is pulsating and the beat matching achieved by the DJ is impressive. Next on the track is “Chandra Surya”, energetic mix of conventional instruments and synthetic sounds with percussive techno beats is lively. But, my personal feeling is that the patriotic song could have been left untouched. After that we have the ever popular “By Road Ko Baato”, this song has a very catchy lyric to start with. The DJ has put vital effort to give it a house mix feel with 4/4 beats. With no doubts it’s simply groovy. Subsequently, we come across “Nachi Deu Maichyang”, the percussion of this song hits you hard. The singers have also poured their heart out to make this song stand our. Next is “Gharbeti Naani”, this song has a urban touch in the beginning but when the lyric is uttered it takes you back to the classics. The captivating rhythm with simple lyrics makes you listen to this song again and again. Then we have the regular 4/4 beat remix called “Maiti Ko Kausi”. It is well vocalized by the singer and I am a big fan of the song’s lyric. On the part of the remix its just the right party starter to set the dancing mood. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>At track 7 we have another controversial number “Bhenda Ko Oon Jasto”, this song has the rocking beats to make anyone jump to the dance floor. The singer can be picked up for some negligible mistakes at times but on the whole the song is pounding. Next on the list is “Jindagani”, the use of flute has made this song truly stand out. Again the blend of beats with standard instrumentation is done seamlessly by the talented DJ. In this song the singer selection could have been better. Consequently we bump into “Saal Ko Paata” it has got all the ingredients to make it a popular dance number. The hard hitting bass beats makes you go wild on the dance floor. The singer has uttered the words skillfully and the lyric is also outstanding. Rappers have also contributed their part to uplift the song. The DJ here deserves 9 out of 10 for this great remix. Next track is “Musu Musu” this is a techno blend of the two songs one in hindi from a movie and the next<span style="">  </span>our own musu musu hansi deu. The singers have completed a remarkable work. Again the beat matching by the DJ seems to be flawless. To conclude we come across “Maichhori Sundari Extended Mix”, with more focus on a power back beginning this song seems to be an instrumental in the beginning. The effort to keep the original sounds intact but still adding new foot tapping beats without polluting the song is admirable. The cross-fade are also actively heard in this song, over all the song is great to put a full stop in any party. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">            </span>On the whole the album is better that the earlier Addiction 1. Almost all the tracks have rappers shouting yo and yeh here and there but they do add vitality to the song. Technically, the professionals have executed there job like the professionals. This album should be included in your top 10 party albums. </p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p><div style="text-align: justify;">  </div><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">Geshan Manandhar (About 650 Word with title)</p><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">Official Details at <a href="http://www.reeyazmusic.com/album.php?name=Addiction2">http://www.reeyazmusic.com/album.php?name=Addiction2</a></p><p style="text-align: justify;" class="MsoNormal">I love to write Music Album Reviews.</p><p style="text-align: center;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 51, 0);">Exclusive</span></p></div>

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RgP8etlXWYI/AAAAAAAAABQ/k4E6p5XXv7U/s1600-h/jimmy_logo_nick.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_L4bRnZ5TPr8/RgP8etlXWYI/AAAAAAAAABQ/k4E6p5XXv7U/s320/jimmy_logo_nick.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5045153612147677570" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt;" /></a><br />My wrist watch is striking 5 after college is over. I have to wait till she gets a micro bus and then run home to catch my favorite TV show “The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron”. You might think it sounds like a cartoon, you are right it is a cartoon show. Previously aired on 5:15 pm now at 5:45 it has eased off the pressure a lot. You might ask why a guy past teen age still watches cartoon!!!  <br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">            The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, an American animated television series, is a spin-off of the Oscar-nominated computer-animated movie; Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, first officially aired in September 2002. This is also the first computer-animated Nicktoon. The first time I watched it, it was in the middle I just loved the graphics. The graphics was great the characters amusing and the comedy very much for the masses not only for the small children. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">The central character is Jimmy Neutron, in the town of <st1:city st="on">Retroville</st1:city>, <st1:state st="on"><st1:place st="on">Texas</st1:place></st1:state>, who gets in and out of trouble by inventing far-out gadgets. Jimmy&#8217;s main catchphrases are &#8220;Gotta Blast!&#8221;, and &#8220;Brain Blast!&#8221;, or simply the most overused phrase, &#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221;, after coming up with the ultimate idea to solve the problem. Jimmy typically has a &#8220;Brain Blast&#8221; once an episode at the climax of the story when all other ideas have failed, and it is accompanied by a visual of his ideas floating within the inner workings of his brain.</div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">He is ten year old genius inventor whose inventions tend to cause more destruction than help, and usually it&#8217;s up to Jimmy to save the day against his own creations. He has an extensive laboratory below his clubhouse which is accessed via hair DNA scan. Carl and Sheen are his best friends. He has a robotic dog named Goddard. </div><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">His never ending fights with Cindy Vortex are another interesting aspect of the show. Though they love each other from inside due to peer pressure and other reasons they always fight. I just love the sequences between those two. On my recommendation many of my friends have added Jimmy to their never miss shows. We all need a way to relax; in reality it’s not possible to relax at the max so in fiction and in cartoon it’s just out of the way to let your imaginations flow. That’s why I love to watch Jimmy, it’s the no. 1 in my rankings just give it a try at 5:45 PM Tuesday-Friday on Nickelodeon channel and feel it for yourself. As far as I can I never miss it, It’s a show that will engulf you in itself for half and hour, try it to believe it.</div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"></div>Geshan Manandhar<br />Around 450 Words<br />I had even Made a website http://jimmyneutron.ifastnet.com using Drupal but couldn&#8217;t update it due to lack of time, If you people like Jimmy and want to help me you are welcome. See the website it has problems still.</div></div>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">You as Mero Mobile user, may have surfed the internet via your GPRS (Global Packet Radio Service) enabled mobile handsets. But have you wondered what GPRS is?</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="">  </span>GPRS (Global Packet Radio Service) is a mobile data service available to users of GSM (Global System for Mobile) mobile phones. It is often described as &#8220;2.5G&#8221;, that is, a technology between the second (2G) and third (3G) generations of mobile telephony. It provides moderate speed data transfer, by using unused TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) channels in the GSM network. GPRS is a mobile data service which utilizes packet switching. It means that multiple users share the same transmission channel, only transmitting when they have data to send. This means that the total available bandwidth can be immediately dedicated to those users who are actually sending at any given moment, providing higher utilization where users only send or receive data intermittently. Web browsing, receiving e-mails as they arrive and instant messaging are examples of uses that require intermittent data transfers, which benefit from sharing the available bandwidth. Usually, GPRS data are billed per kilobytes of information transceived. Mero mobile (Spice <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Nepal</st1:place></st1:country-region>) charges Rs 0.20 for every 10 Kb traffic or Rs 750 Per month for unlimited access. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">GPRS is a connectivity solution based on Internet Protocols that supports a wide range of enterprise and consumer applications. With throughput rates of up to 40 kbit/s, users have a similar access speed to a dial-up modem, but with the convenience of being able to connect from anywhere. In addition to the IP (Internet Protocol), GPRS supports X.25, a packet-based protocol that is used mainly in Europe. GPRS is an evolutionary step toward EDGE (Enhanced Data GSM Environment) and UMTS (Universal Mobile Telephone Service). Almost all the new cell phone models support GPRS; some models that support GPRS are Nokia 6100, Sony Eriksson 300i, Samsung D500, LG D2100. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">EDGE (Enhanced Data GSM Environment), a faster version of the GSM wireless service, is designed to deliver data at rates up to 384 Kbps and enable the delivery of multimedia and other broadband applications to mobile phone. The EDGE standard is built on the existing GSM standard, using the same TDMA frame structure and existing cell arrangements. The Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA) states that, as of April 2006, there were 139 commercial GSM/EDGE networks in 78 countries, out of a total of 192 EDGE deployments in 102 countries. The regional breakdown of commercial EDGE networks is 59 in Europe, 45 in the Americas and Caribbean, 21 in Asia, and 14 in Africa and the Middle East. GPRS is the present and EDGE may be the future, let&#8217;s hope we would also step up to EDGE some day.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;"><o:p> </o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;">By Geshan Manandhar </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 9pt;">About 450 Words</p>  Published on &#8220;In YOur Face&#8221; Magazine July 2007 Issue, Now NTC is also launching GPRS in near Future for Pre-Paid users and its available for Post-Paid Users.</div>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix" itemprop="articleBody description"><div class='post'>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Web 2.0 or simply web2 hasn’t caught the hype in our country but is the next big thing in developed nations. In the yesteryears the concept of websites flowed like this, one information provider and many information consumers. But it is a different setting in the present circumstance, now there are many information producers/providers and many information consumers which create a many to many information sharing base. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">            </span>Web 2.0 may seem like a very technical word trying to specify the version 2 of the current web infrastructure that is becoming a part of our high tech life. But it is not, Web 2.0 is a word coined by O&#8217;Reilly Media in the year 2004, that refers to the supposed second-generation of Internet-based services that let people collaborate and share information online in perceived new ways such as social networking sites, wikis, communication tools, and folksonomies. So Web 2.0 is straightforward and clear concept that advocates the websites should be a platform where all the visitors can actively participate. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">It is quite clear that Web 2.0 primarily focuses on open content and is supportive to open source. Giving emphasis on community, it is encouraging collaborative works. Hence eventually Web 2.0 tries to achieve information for the people & by the people, so as to parting the traditional Web 1.0 environment where content provider was only one and information consumers were many. In Web 2.0 the numbers of information provides and consumers will be almost same. Web 2.0 is a concept that persuades website viewers to participate and feel the belongingness to the website or the web application.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">So you might be asking what are the concrete differences in the new concept Web 2.0 and the earlier one? The answers unfold here, earlier we used to peruse through the Britannica Online encyclopedia where one who is reading if s/he finds new things on that topic is directly not able to add or alter any content but in Wikipedia it is easily possible. In any topic by collaborative effort we get great articles from wikipedia that also at no cost and no legal difficulties. Previously people used to have personal websites, now it is the era of blogging. <span style="" lang="EN">A <span style="">weblog</span>, which is usually shortened to <span style="">blog</span>, is a type of website where entries are made (such as in a journal or diary), displayed in a reverse chronological order.</span><span lang="EN"> </span>Thus, personal websites have now turned in to blogs the personal web diary of people.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Commercially, people paid for advertisement or other pages on the basis of page view but now in web 2.0 the cost is charged on the basis of cost per click. Earlier it was the concept of publishing and not letting anyone comment on it or even copy it. But now in web 2.0 the concept of participation has prevailed. In web 1.0 there used to be directories or taxonomy of the links and all other things but now it’s the age of tagging or folksonomy with a community effort. The lacking social aspect in the websites has been incredibly stressed in the new concept of web 2.0.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">As the websites based on the web 2.0 concept look forward for the participation of all the interested people so it focuses on simple design but rich features. The feature rich interface will give the even novice web users their space to participate in the website. One Nepali website that is totally based on web 2.0 and provides features like blogging, commenting on the text etc etc is <a href="http://fossnepal.org/">http://fossnepal.org</a>. If you know about Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) it is a must see for you, if you don’t know about FOSS then it is a compulsory visit for you.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in;">Eagerly let’s hope that all the websites and webmasters will get the concept of Web 2.0 in near future. Going to Web 2.0 does not mean that you just add a guest book and it’s done. I’m not even advising that all website should follow web 2.0 as a company websites need not follow web 2.0. But if the webmasters transform their Web 1.0 websites to the new Web 2.0 it will be beneficial to both parties the developers and the website visitors. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">Geshan Manandhar<o:p></o:p></span></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">About 700 Words</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="">This article was published on &#8220;In Your Face&#8221; Magazine Feb 06 Issue.<br /></span></p><br /><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"></p></div>
